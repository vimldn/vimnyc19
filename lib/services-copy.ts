    commonChallenges:
      'Co-op/condo building rules, service elevator scheduling, and curb access on narrow side streets.',
    context:
      `Upper East Side buildings skew toward doorman co-ops and large elevator buildings, with a meaningful pocket of older walk-ups in Yorkville. That mix matters for any service visit: co-ops often require a certificate of insurance, approved vendor lists, and scheduled elevator time, while older walk-ups turn every job into a stairs-and-hallways logistics problem. Street conditions are also different block to block — quiet side streets near Park Avenue can be easier to stage on, while 2nd/3rd Avenue corridors are busier and more constrained.

Transit access is excellent (4/5/6 and Q), but vehicle access is the real variable; double-parking rules and limited loading zones can slow appointments. The neighborhood’s building age range also means you’ll see everything from older steam heat systems to modernized high-rises, so the “same” issue (leaks, pests, noise) can have totally different root causes depending on the building type. If you’re comparing addresses, Building Health X helps you see whether problems are isolated to one property or consistent across a few nearby buildings.`,

    context:
      `Upper West Side housing runs from pre-war elevator buildings along West End and Central Park West to brownstones and newer towers closer to Columbus. Pre-war stock can mean thick walls (good for noise) but older plumbing, radiators, and legacy building infrastructure that needs careful maintenance. Co-ops are common, and that usually translates into clear rules for vendors, proof of insurance, and specific move/service windows.

Transit is strong (1/2/3 and A/B/C/D), which helps for appointments that rely on subway access, but trucks and vans still contend with park traffic, school drop-offs, and busy avenues. The neighborhood’s mix of family buildings and high-foot-traffic corridors also means you’ll want to evaluate entry security and package areas carefully. Building Health X is useful here because it turns DOB/311/HPD signals into a quick “is this building improving or worsening” view across multiple time windows.`,

      `Harlem’s housing stock is diverse: landmarked brownstones, pre-war walk-ups, and newer mid-rise buildings along corridors like 125th and Frederick Douglass. That variety affects everything from move logistics to pest prevention — older masonry and shared basements can create entry points, while newer buildings may have stricter concierge and elevator policies.

Subway access is broad (2/3, A/B/C/D, 1), making it convenient to visit by transit, but vehicle access can swing from straightforward avenues to tight side streets with limited loading space. Harlem also sees meaningful renovation and new construction activity, so DOB complaints and permits can be a useful early signal when you’re deciding whether a building is actively being improved or is stuck in a cycle of patchwork repairs. Building Health X helps you compare recent activity (30/90 days) against longer patterns (1–3 years) so you can spot whether issues are seasonal or structural.`,

    context:
      `East Village is defined by older walk-ups and mixed-use buildings where restaurants and bars sit below apartments. That’s great for energy and convenience, but it changes what “building health” looks like: nighttime noise, trash storage, and pest pressure are common watch-outs, and older plumbing and steam systems can mean recurring maintenance patterns.

Because curb space is scarce and street activity is high, any service that requires equipment, a van, or repeated visits benefits from careful scheduling. Transit is strong (L and 4/5/6 nearby), but deliveries and appointments often depend on navigating busy avenues and narrow side streets. The neighborhood’s block-by-block variability is exactly where Building Health X helps: you can check whether a given address has a recent spike in 311 noise, HPD complaints, or DOB issues — and whether it’s trending better over the last year or getting worse.`,

      `West Village skews low-rise and historic: townhouses, small co-ops, and older buildings on narrow, often one-way streets. That makes vehicle staging and loading a real factor — even quick appointments can take longer if there’s nowhere to stop. Many buildings have older envelopes and mechanicals, which can translate into seasonal comfort issues and maintenance that’s more “craft” than plug-and-play.

Transit access is strong, but for services that rely on vans or equipment, the street grid matters as much as the subway map. Landmark and historic-district considerations can also influence what owners can change quickly, which is why it’s useful to look at patterns over time. Building Health X lets you see the practical signals (HPD complaints, 311, DOB complaints) so you’re not relying on glossy listing photos to judge whether a building is well-run.`,

That mix changes the practical checklist: modern towers may have strict move-in procedures and concierge rules, while older loft conversions can have quirks around freight elevators, deliveries, and building access.

Chelsea’s proximity to major transit hubs and active development corridors means you’ll often see construction-related noise, temporary street closures, and heavier vehicle traffic. For renters, it’s worth checking whether a building’s “newly renovated” claims line up with complaint and violation patterns.

      `Tribeca is famous for loft conversions and boutique luxury buildings. Those loft layouts can be a dream, but they also bring specific operational realities: freight-style elevators, loading procedures, and building rules that are often enforced tightly. Street access can be tricky on narrower blocks, and timing matters when traffic stacks up.

Because many Tribeca buildings are condos or co-ops with professional management, the paper trail for any service visit can be more formal — COIs, scheduling windows, and building staff coordination. For renters, the biggest question is often whether a building’s day-to-day operations match its premium pricing. Building Health X helps by turning the “invisible” signals — HPD issues, 311 complaints, DOB complaints — into a quick reality check.`,

      `Hell’s Kitchen has a high density of rentals, from older walk-ups to newer towers closer to the Hudson. The neighborhood’s proximity to Port Authority and the Lincoln Tunnel shapes daily conditions: traffic, street noise, and late-night activity can all influence how a building feels — especially on lower floors or avenue-facing units.

Transit options are excellent, but curb access for vans and service providers can be unpredictable. Many buildings are mixed-use, and that can increase wear on common areas and create pest pressure if trash storage isn’t managed well. Building Health X is useful here because you can compare a building’s recent 311 noise and HPD patterns to longer windows, and see whether management is proactively improving things or reacting after the fact.`,

The tower set tends to have formal move procedures (elevator reservations, COIs, time windows), while older stock can have tighter stairs, older plumbing, and more variable management quality.

Transit is strong (L/G and ferry), but vehicle access is shaped by bridge traffic and busy retail corridors, so timing matters for services that require a van or multiple visits. The neighborhood’s pace of renovation also means DOB filings can be a helpful signal when you’re trying to understand whether a building is being actively improved.

Those conversions can look beautiful, but they often have unique pest entry points: loading-bay doors, utility penetrations, and shared basement spaces that weren’t originally designed for residential living. Small multi-family buildings can also vary widely in maintenance standards depending on ownership.

Transit access depends on the exact pocket (L vs J/M/Z), and service logistics depend on curb space and block layout. Seasonal factors matter too: heavy rain can reveal building envelope issues, and hot summers can amplify trash and pest pressure if storage is limited. Building Health X helps you see recent HPD and 311 signals — and whether the trajectory is improving — so you can choose a building that’s being managed, not just marketed.`,

That often means shared basements, older plumbing stacks, and building envelopes that need consistent upkeep. Many rentals are in smaller buildings without full-time staff, so management responsiveness matters a lot.

Transit coverage is good (A/C and G nearby for many areas), but service appointments are shaped by curb access and the specific street. Basement moisture after storms can be a hidden driver of pests and odors, and entry security can vary widely based on hardware and lighting. Building Health X is useful here because it surfaces patterns from HPD and 311 so you can validate whether a landlord’s “we take care of things quickly” claim matches the building’s record.`,

Brownstones are charming, but they create specific logistics: narrow stairwells, multiple floors, and older mechanical systems that can require ongoing attention. Many buildings are family-heavy, which can translate into stricter building rules and more sensitivity to noise and scheduling.

Transit is excellent, but service work often depends on vehicle staging on narrow streets. When you’re renting, it’s worth checking how the building handles common pain points like heat consistency, water pressure, and trash storage.

For walk-ups, confirm how many flights your crew expects and whether bulky items need disassembly.

Street conditions matter too. ${profile.transit} Busy corridors and limited loading can create “hidden costs” if a truck can’t stage close to the entrance. A good mover in ${location.name} will proactively plan for curb access, communicate arrival windows, and protect common areas to avoid building fines. Seasonal timing also matters — summer weekends can be crowded and winter weather can slow carries.

Before you sign a lease, run the address in Building Health X to sanity-check the building’s record. If you see recurring elevator outages, DOB complaints, or frequent resident reviews about management delays, you may want extra buffer time (and stronger documentation) for move-in coordination.`

        `${baseIntro} Tenant-law issues are rarely generic — they’re shaped by building type and management behavior. ${profile.buildingStock} In neighborhoods with older stock, you may see recurring heat/hot water disputes, repair delays, or access issues during renovations. A tenant lawyer can help you document conditions, understand your options, and communicate in a way that creates a clear record if the situation escalates.

Local context changes the playbook. In ${location.name}, it’s common to need guidance on lease renewals, habitability complaints, security deposit disputes, and how to respond when a landlord claims a problem is “temporary” but the pattern repeats. Seasonal issues also show up — winter heat problems and summer pest pressure are the usual triggers.

Building Health X can support your documentation by showing objective, time-windowed signals tied to the address (HPD complaints, DOB complaints, 311 noise trends). If you’re choosing counsel, look for someone who can translate those signals into a clear strategy: what to request, what to document, and what timeline is realistic for resolution.`

        `${baseIntro} Renter’s insurance decisions are very building-specific. ${profile.buildingStock} In doorman towers you might worry less about package theft but more about water damage from neighboring units; in older walk-ups, plumbing backups and radiator/steam incidents can be more common. In either case, the key is choosing coverage that matches how the building actually behaves.

In ${location.name}, think through the risks that show up in everyday living: does the building have a history of leaks, recurring maintenance delays, or security issues? Coverage choices like personal property limits, loss-of-use (temporary housing), and liability can matter more than the headline premium. If you’re near busy corridors, consider add-ons that fit higher foot traffic and delivery volume.

Use Building Health X as a reality check. If the address shows repeated HPD or DOB activity related to building systems, that’s a cue to pay attention to water damage coverage and loss-of-use. If noise/security complaints are prominent, it’s a reminder to document valuables and consider how you receive packages. Insurance is cheapest when you set it up before problems start — and most useful when it matches the building’s actual risk profile.`

    case 'pest-control':

        `${baseIntro} Pest issues in NYC are usually building-system issues: trash storage, basement moisture, gaps around pipes, and neighbor-to-neighbor spread. ${profile.buildingStock} In older stock, shared basements and utility chases can make it easy for roaches and mice to move between units. In mixed-use buildings, food uses and frequent deliveries can increase pressure if waste handling isn’t tight.

In ${location.name}, a good pest control provider should start with inspection and exclusion — sealing entry points, addressing moisture, and coordinating with building management — not just repeated spraying. Ask how they handle common NYC pests (roaches, mice, bed bugs) and whether they provide documentation you can share with management. Timing matters too: summer brings higher roach activity, and colder months often push mice indoors.

Building Health X can help you decide whether a problem is isolated or systemic. If you see persistent HPD-related complaint patterns tied to sanitation, pests, or building maintenance, that’s a sign you may need building-wide action, not just a unit-level treatment. Use the 30/90-day window to see if management is responding, and the 1–3 year view to see whether the issue is chronic.`

Look for practical features: loading bays or easy curb access, elevator availability, wide corridors for carts, and hours that match your schedule. Climate control can be worth it if you’re storing anything sensitive to humidity (books, instruments, electronics). Security matters too — cameras and controlled access are baseline, but staffing and lighting can make a real difference.

Use Building Health X to plan proactively. If your building has ongoing repairs, DOB activity, or recurring maintenance issues, short-term storage can give you flexibility during disruptions. And if you’re moving within the neighborhood, storage can help you avoid forcing a tight move-out/move-in overlap.`

In newer buildings, the focus shifts to workmanship, ventilation, and whether systems are operating as advertised.

In ${location.name}, inspectors who understand NYC rentals will look beyond the unit’s fresh paint. They’ll check the “invisible” risks: moisture in basements, evidence of recurring leaks, window/door sealing that affects noise and drafts, and the building’s operational basics (trash, security, egress). Seasonal context matters — winter reveals heating issues, and summer reveals ventilation and pest pressure.

Pair the inspection with Building Health X. If the address shows repeated HPD/DOB activity, bring that to the inspection and ask targeted questions. The goal is not perfection — it’s knowing what’s likely to become your problem after you sign.`
