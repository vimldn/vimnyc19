<i>Ever woken up to roaches crawling across your kitchen counter in your NYC rental?</i> You're not alone-and if you're a landlord, ignoring it could cost you big. NYC's strict Housing Maintenance Code and Multiple Dwelling Law demand prompt action on pests. Discover infestation triggers, extermination timelines, common pest schedules, your responsibilities, penalties, and best practices to stay compliant and pest-free. <b>Read on to protect your property (and peace of mind).</b><h2>NYC Legal Requirements for Pest Control</h2><img alt="NYC Legal Requirements for Pest Control" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/how-often-must-nyc-landlords-exterminate(homg)_1.jpeg"/> <p>NYC landlords must comply with <b>Section 27-2017 of the Housing Maintenance Code (HMC)</b>, which mandates extermination of roaches, rats, and <a href="/blog/is-my-nyc-landlord-responsible-for-bed-bug-extermination">bed bug</a>s within 1-7 days of notice. The NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) receives over 45,000 pest complaints each year. These rules ensure buildings meet <b>habitability standards</b> and protect tenant health.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Want to sanity-check a specific address? <a href="/">Search it on Building Health X</a> to see recent heat/hot water, pests, noise, safety and violations across 30/90 days, 1 year and 3 years.</p> <p>Section 27-2017 HMC defines <b>'vermin'</b> as rats, mice, roaches, bed bugs, and other insects or rodents that create unsanitary conditions. Landlords must remove these pests promptly after tenant complaints or inspections. Failure to act leads to <b>Class C violations</b> and potential fines.</p> <p><b>Local Law 55</b> requires bed bug disclosure within 21 days of tenant notice of infestation. Landlords must notify prospective tenants about past bed bug history in the unit. This promotes transparency in <b>rent-stabilized apartments</b> and private rentals alike.</p> <p>Practical steps include scheduling a <b>professional exterminator</b> for spraying, baiting, or traps. Tenants should report issues via 311 service requests for official records. Regular <b>pest inspections</b> help prevent recurring issues in multifamily dwellings.</p> <h3>Housing Maintenance Code Basics</h3> <p><b>Section 27-2017 HMC</b> specifically states: 'The owner shall keep and maintain the building, premises and every multiple dwelling, including its roof, yards, cellars, areaways, sidewalks, courts, areaways, and all appurtenances free from conditions which endanger the life, health, safety or welfare of the occupants.' This covers <b>pest control</b> for roaches, rodents, and insects. Landlords face immediate obligations upon notice.</p> <p>Key sections include 27-2017 for extermination, which demands prompt removal of vermin. <b>Section 27-2008</b> requires building cleanliness to prevent infestations. <b>Section 27-2018</b> mandates proper garbage removal, and Section 27-2029 calls for window screens during warm months.</p> <ul><li>Exterminate roaches in kitchen areas after tenant complaints.</li> <li>Seal cracks in basements to block mice entry.</li> <li>Install screens on windows to keep out summer insects.</li> <li>Clear garbage chutes regularly in walk-up buildings.</li></ul> <p>In 2023, HPD issued 28,451 <b>Class C pest violations</b>. Property managers should maintain extermination logs and service reports. Tenant cooperation, like proper food storage, supports <b>preventive maintenance</b>.</p> <h3>Multiple Dwelling Law Provisions</h3> <p><b>Multiple Dwelling Law Section 78</b> requires landlords of buildings with 3+ units to maintain 'sanitary conditions' including pest-free common areas like hallways and stairwells. This applies to <b>multifamily dwellings</b>, co-op apartments, and condos. Landlords must address rodents in laundry rooms or garbage areas quickly.</p> <p>For rent-stabilized apartments, DHCR Fact Sheet #24 outlines extermination duties under lease agreements. NYCHA properties follow separate <b>integrated pest management (IPM)</b> standards with bi-annual treatments. Single-family rentals fall under general HMC rules but still require prompt action.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Building Type</th><th>Law</th><th>Specific Requirement</th><th>Citation</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Multifamily (3+ units)</td><td>Multiple Dwelling Law</td><td>Pest-free common areas, exterminate upon notice</td><td>78</td></tr> <tr><td>Rent-stabilized</td><td>DHCR Guidelines</td><td>Recurring pest control, tenant notifications</td><td>Fact Sheet #24</td></tr> <tr><td>NYCHA public housing</td><td>NYCHA IPM Policy</td><td>Green pest control, seasonal inspections</td><td>IPM Standards</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Owners of high-risk buildings, like those with basement infestations, need <b>quarterly pest control</b>. Document treatments with photos for <b>HPD compliance audits</b>. This avoids fines and supports tenant rights in disputes.</p> <h2>Triggers Requiring Extermination</h2> <p>HPD distinguishes between <b>imminent danger</b> and <b>hazardous violations</b> for pest issues in New York City. Imminent danger prompts faster action, like live rats in a unit, while hazardous covers ongoing problems such as roach sightings. Tenants often trigger these through complaints.</p> <p>Extermination becomes legally required when tenants file <b>311 complaints</b> or landlords receive two written notices of the same pest within 30 days. This aligns with <b>Housing Maintenance Code</b> standards under Section 27-2017 HMC. NYC landlords must act to avoid fines for non-compliance.</p> <p>In rent-stabilized apartments and multifamily dwellings, recurring pest issues like bed bugs or roaches demand professional exterminator services. Landlords should document all notices and treatments. Preventive measures, such as sealing cracks and proper garbage disposal, help reduce triggers.</p> <p>For high-risk buildings like walk-up structures or those with basement infestations, early intervention prevents escalation. Property management teams track tenant complaints via 311 service requests. Compliance ensures habitability standards and avoids rent abatement claims.</p> <h3>Infestation Thresholds</h3> <p>HPD defines <b>bed bug infestation</b> as 1+ live bugs per unit; roach infestation as 10+ live roaches in kitchen/bathroom during inspection. These thresholds trigger Class C violations or worse. Visual inspection criteria guide NYC HPD pest inspections.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Pest</th><th>Threshold</th><th>Class C Violation</th><th>HPD Standard</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Bed bugs</td><td>1 live bug</td><td>Yes</td><td>Visual inspection in unit</td></tr> <tr><td>Roaches</td><td>10+ in kitchen</td><td>Yes</td><td>Live count during inspection</td></tr> <tr><td>Rats</td><td>1 sighting + droppings</td><td>Immediate hazard</td><td>Droppings, gnaw marks</td></tr> <tr><td>Mice</td><td>5+ droppings</td><td>Yes</td><td>Droppings, nests in walls</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Landlords in co-op apartments or condo associations use these thresholds for <b>integrated pest management</b> plans. For example, finding <i>droppings under sinks</i> signals mice issues. Certified pest control follows HPD standards to clear violations.</p> <p>In common areas like hallways or laundry rooms, thresholds apply building-wide. Seasonal pests, such as summer roaches, require quarterly pest control. Tenants cooperate by maintaining cleanliness to meet these legal requirements.</p> <h3>Tenant Complaint Protocols</h3><img alt="Tenant Complaint Protocols" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/how-often-must-nyc-landlords-exterminate(homg)_2.jpeg"/> <p>Tenants must call <b>311 for pests</b>; landlords have 7 days for Class C violations, 24 hours for <b>immediate danger</b> like live rats in a unit. This protocol enforces landlord obligations under NYC Administrative Code. Prompt response prevents health code violations.</p> <ol><li>Tenant calls 311 to report vermin or insects.</li> <li>HPD assigns violation as Class C or Immediately Hazardous.</li> <li>Landlord receives notification via email, text, or letter.</li> <li>Extermination deadline sets based on violation class.</li> <li>Re-inspection occurs 21 days post-treatment.</li></ol> <p>Building superintendents log these steps for compliance audits. In Section 8 vouchers or NYCHA properties, protocols include photo evidence and service reports. Landlords arrange spraying, baiting, or traps with professional exterminators.</p> <p>For recurring issues in studio apartments or family dwellings, protocols demand post-treatment verification. Tenants rights include warranty of habitability, with options for rent abatement if ignored. Documentation like extermination logs supports defenses in landlord-tenant disputes or OATH hearings.</p> <h2>Standard Extermination Frequency</h2> <p>High-risk NYC buildings require <b>monthly roach treatments</b>; moderate risk need quarterly; low-risk buildings semi-annually per IPM standards. The NYC DOHMH IPM guidelines base <b>extermination frequency</b> on a building's risk score from the 2022 Vector Control report. This approach helps NYC landlords manage pests in multifamily dwellings effectively.</p> <p>Risk scores consider factors like past <b>infestation reports</b>, tenant complaints via 311, and HPD violation notices. For rent-stabilized apartments, landlords must follow these to meet Housing Maintenance Code standards. Preventive maintenance reduces recurring pest issues in common areas like hallways and stairwells.</p> <p>Landlords in high-risk buildings, often walk-up structures with basement infestations, face stricter schedules. Low-risk co-op apartments or luxury buildings enjoy less frequent visits. Always document pest inspections and extermination logs for compliance audits.</p> <p>Experts recommend combining IPM with tenant cooperation, such as proper garbage disposal. This minimizes <b>class C violations</b> from HPD and supports habitability standards under Section 27-2017 HMC. Professional exterminators certified in NYC ensure safe, effective treatments.</p> <h3>Routine Preventive Treatments</h3> <p>IPM requires <b>quarterly gel baiting for roaches</b> + bi-annual crack/seal + monthly common area inspections in multifamily buildings. NYC landlords use this schedule to prevent roaches, rodents, and bed bugs in apartments. It aligns with Local Law 55 and vector control guidelines.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Building Risk</th><th>Roach Treatment</th><th>Rodent Baiting</th><th>Bed Bug Monitoring</th><th>Total Annual Cost</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Low</td><td>Semi-annual</td><td>Quarterly</td><td>Bi-annual</td><td>$2,400</td></tr> <tr><td>Medium</td><td>Quarterly</td><td>Bi-monthly</td><td>Quarterly</td><td>$4,800</td></tr> <tr><td>High</td><td>Monthly</td><td>Monthly</td><td>Monthly</td><td>$9,600</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Approved IPM methods include <b>gel baits</b>, insect growth regulators, and monitoring stations. For example, place bait stations in laundry rooms and garbage chutes. Building superintendents oversee monthly checks in high-risk properties like NYCHA buildings.</p> <p>Landlords in single-family rentals or condo associations adapt schedules to risk levels. Seal cracks in summer to block roaches, and inspect attics for winter rodents. These steps reduce allergen triggers and support child safety in family dwellings.</p> <h3>Reactive Extermination Timelines</h3> <p>Class C violations require treatment within 7 days; Immediately Hazardous (live rats) within 24 hours; bed bugs within 30 days. NYC HPD enforces these timelines after tenant complaints or 311 service requests. Landlords must act fast to avoid fines for non-compliance.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Violation Class</th><th>Response Time</th><th>Example Pests</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Immediately Hazardous</td><td>24 hours</td><td>Live rats, severe roach swarms</td></tr> <tr><td>Hazardous (Class C)</td><td>7 days</td><td>Mice infestations, rodent droppings</td></tr> <tr><td>Less than Hazardous</td><td>30 days</td><td>Bed bugs, occasional insects</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>If landlords miss deadlines, HPD issues escalation notices leading to OATH hearings or fines. For emergency extermination in elevator buildings, hire certified pest control immediately. Document photo evidence and service reports for defense in landlord-tenant disputes.</p> <p>Tenants in low-income or senior housing often report via 311, triggering inspections. Landlords should provide notice of infestation and post-treatment verification. This protects against rent abatement claims or constructive eviction defenses in small claims court.</p> <h2>Common Pests and Schedules</h2> <p>Roaches need <b>monthly gel treatments</b> year-round; bed bugs require 2-3 treatments 14 days apart; rats need weekly bait station checks. NYC landlords must follow these schedules to meet Housing Maintenance Code standards and prevent class C violations from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Proper timing reduces recurring pest issues in multifamily dwellings and rent-stabilized apartments.</p> <p><b>Integrated pest management</b> or IPM guides treatment frequency for common pests like roaches, rodents, and bed bugs. Landlords should schedule <b>professional exterminators</b> certified for New York City properties to handle seasonal peaks. This approach includes preventive maintenance such as sealing cracks and ensuring tenant cooperation on cleanliness requirements.</p> <p>For <b>high-risk buildings</b> like walk-up buildings or those with basement infestations, more frequent pest inspections help avoid tenant complaints and 311 service requests. Building superintendents often coordinate with property management for bi-annual treatments in common areas like hallways and laundry rooms. Documenting extermination logs and service reports supports compliance audits and defends against landlord-tenant disputes.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Pest</th> <th>Peak Season</th> <th>Treatment Frequency</th> <th>Methods</th> <th>Warranty Period</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>German Cockroach</td> <td>All year</td> <td>Monthly gel treatments</td> <td>Gel baits, perimeter spray</td> <td>30 days</td></tr> <tr><td>Bed Bugs</td> <td>Spring/summer</td> <td>2-3 treatments, 14 days apart</td> <td>Steam cleaning, chemical sprays</td> <td>90 days</td></tr> <tr><td>Norway Rats</td> <td>Winter</td> <td>Weekly bait station checks</td> <td>Bait stations, sanitation</td> <td>Ongoing</td></tr> <tr><td>House Mice</td> <td>Fall/winter</td> <td>Bi-weekly trap monitoring</td> <td>Snap traps, tamper-resistant bait boxes</td> <td>60 days</td></tr> <tr><td>Water Bugs</td> <td>Summer</td> <td>Quarterly perimeter treatments</td> <td>Insecticide dusts, void injections</td> <td>45 days</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>This table outlines extermination frequency tailored to NYC conditions, helping landlords plan pest control contracts. Warranty periods allow for re-treatments if re-infestation occurs, protecting against emergency extermination demands. Always verify post-treatment with photo evidence for HPD inspections.</p> <h2>Landlord Responsibilities vs. Tenant Duties</h2><img alt="Landlord Responsibilities vs. Tenant Duties" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/how-often-must-nyc-landlords-exterminate(homg)_3.jpeg"/> <p>Landlords handle <b>hiring certified exterminators</b> and sealing cracks. Tenants must clean daily, report pests within <b>48 hours</b>, and store food properly. This division ensures quick response to <i>roaches</i>, <i>rodents</i>, and other vermin under NYC rules.</p> <p>NYC Housing Maintenance Code (HMC) outlines these roles clearly. Landlords focus on professional pest control like spraying and baiting. Tenants support by maintaining cleanliness to prevent infestations in rent-stabilized apartments.</p> <p>Conflicts arise when duties overlap, such as in common areas. Both parties must cooperate for integrated pest management (IPM). Proper handling avoids class C violations from NYC HPD.</p> <p>The <b>warranty of habitability</b> protects tenants if landlords fail. Cases like those under Section 27-2017 HMC show rent abatement for neglected extermination. Tenants can file 311 complaints for enforcement.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Responsibility</th> <th>Landlord</th> <th>Tenant</th> <th>Legal Citation</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><b>Extermination hiring</b></td> <td>Hire certified pest control professionals for treatments like fumigation and traps.</td> <td>Report issues promptly but do not hire independently.</td> <td>Section 27-2017 HMC</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Crack sealing</b></td> <td>Seal entry points in walls, floors, and pipes during pest inspections.</td> <td>Avoid creating new openings; report visible cracks.</td> <td>Housing Maintenance Code</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Garbage removal</b></td> <td>Provide functional chutes and bins in multifamily dwellings.</td> <td>Remove trash daily and tie bags securely.</td> <td>Local Law 55</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Food storage</b></td> <td>Ensure kitchen areas support sealed containers.</td> <td>Store food in airtight containers, clean spills immediately.</td> <td>Sanitation Department rules</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Reporting timelines</b></td> <td>Respond to tenant complaints within set periods for emergency extermination.</td> <td>Notify landlord or 311 within 48 hours of noticing pests.</td> <td>NYC Administrative Code</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Common area maintenance</b></td> <td>Clean hallways, stairwells, laundry rooms, and exteriors regularly.</td> <td>Report issues in shared spaces like garbage chutes.</td> <td>Title 27 Chapter 2</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Bed bug protocols</b></td> <td>Conduct pre-move-in inspections and post-treatment verification.</td> <td>Cooperate with preparation like laundering bedding.</td> <td>Local Law 196</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Preventive measures</b></td> <td>Install window screens and schedule quarterly pest control.</td> <td>Maintain personal unit cleanliness to avoid re-infestation.</td> <td>Warranty of habitability cases</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Documentation</b></td> <td>Keep extermination logs, service reports, and photo evidence.</td> <td>Provide notice of infestation with details.</td> <td>HPD violation notices</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Rodent control</b></td> <td>Set baiting stations and check basements, attics.</td> <td>Avoid feeding stray animals or leaving food out.</td> <td>Vector control guidelines</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Seasonal pests</b></td> <td>Increase frequency for summer roaches or winter rodents.</td> <td>Monitor and report seasonal changes promptly.</td> <td>Department of Health rules</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Re-infestation response</b></td> <td>Implement re-treatment and audits for high-risk buildings.</td> <td>Follow post-treatment rules like vacuuming.</td> <td>OATH hearings precedents</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>This table highlights key divisions in <b>landlord obligations</b> and <b>tenant rights</b>. For example, in walk-up buildings, landlords manage roof access for exterior pests. Tenants in studio apartments focus on daily habits to support building-wide efforts.</p> <p>Experts recommend clear lease agreements on these duties. Property management should track compliance to avoid fines. Tenants gain leverage in disputes through proper reporting.</p> <h2>Penalties for Non-Compliance</h2> <p>Class C pest violations carry <b>$250-$500 fines</b> per violation per apartment. Repeat offenders face <b>$2,000+ civil penalties</b>. NYC HPD enforces these under the Housing Maintenance Code.</p> <p>In 2023, HPD collected <b>over $12 million</b> in pest violation fines. This shows the financial risk for <b>NYC landlords</b> ignoring pest control. Landlords must address tenant complaints quickly to avoid escalation.</p> <p>A Bronx landlord faced a <b>$150,000 fine</b> for over 300 untreated units with roaches and rodents. The case involved repeated <b>violation notices</b> from 311 service requests. Courts upheld the penalty due to health hazards like asthma triggers.</p> <p>Landlords can reduce risks with preventive maintenance and professional exterminators. Keep extermination logs and service reports for compliance audits. Tenant cooperation on cleanliness helps prevent infestations.</p> <h3>Fines and Fees Overview</h3> <table><thead><tr><th>Violation Class</th><th>Fine Range</th><th>Re-inspection Fee</th><th>Criminal Penalty</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><b>Class C</b> (e.g., roaches, mice)</td><td>$250-$500 per unit</td><td>$125-$300</td><td>Misdemeanor, up to 1 year jail</td><td>Infestation in rent-stabilized apartment</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Class B</b> (e.g., severe bed bugs)</td><td>$500-$1,000 per unit</td><td>$200-$400</td><td>Felony possible for repeats</td><td>Multiple units with untreated vermin</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Class A</b> (minor issues)</td><td>$100-$250 per unit</td><td>$100</td><td>Rarely criminal</td><td>Single rodent sighting in hallway</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>This table outlines <b>HPD penalties</b> for pest violations. Fines apply per apartment in multifamily dwellings. Repeat issues lead to higher costs and possible DOB violations.</p> <p>Landlords should schedule quarterly pest control to stay compliant. Document treatments with photos and reports. This protects against OATH hearings and rent abatement claims.</p> <p><b>Re-inspection fees</b> add up quickly after failed pest inspections. HPD charges for each follow-up visit. Prompt extermination prevents these extra landlord expenses.</p> <p>Criminal penalties target willful neglect, like ignoring emergency extermination requests. Property management must prioritize habitability standards. Use integrated pest management for long-term control.</p> <h2>Best Practices for Compliance</h2> <p>NYC landlords must follow <b>strict guidelines</b> to meet extermination requirements under the Housing Maintenance Code and Local Law 55. These practices help prevent <b>infestations</b> of bed bugs, roaches, rodents, and other vermin in rent-stabilized apartments and multifamily dwellings. Adopting them reduces violation notices from NYC HPD and ensures tenant rights to habitability.</p> <p>Key steps include hiring only <b>NYS DEC-licensed exterminators</b> for all pest control work. Maintain detailed digital extermination logs in a format like Orkin reports to document spraying, baiting, traps, and fumigation. Conduct <b>quarterly IPM audits</b> using integrated pest management to address recurring pest issues proactively.</p> <p>Provide <b>pre/post-treatment tenant notices</b> with 48-hour advance warning for apartment extermination. Perform <b>monthly inspections</b> in common areas like hallways, stairwells, laundry rooms, and garbage chutes. Schedule bi-annual bed bug dog sweeps and an annual crack/caulk program to seal entry points in basements, attics, and exteriors.</p> <p>Develop a <b>311 response SOP</b> for tenant complaints and emergency extermination requests. These measures support preventive maintenance, allergen reduction, and child safety in high-risk buildings like walk-up structures and NYCHA properties. They also aid in lease agreements and defenses against rent abatement claims.</p> <h3>NYC-Compliant Extermination Practices</h3> <ul><li>Use <b>NYS DEC-licensed exterminators only</b> for professional pest control, ensuring certified handling of roaches, mice, rats, and insects.</li> <li>Maintain <b>digital extermination logs</b> in Orkin format, including photo evidence, service reports, and post-treatment verification.</li> <li>Conduct quarterly IPM audits to monitor infestation risks in single-family rentals, co-op apartments, and luxury buildings.</li> <li>Issue pre/post-treatment tenant notices with 48-hour advance alerts, respecting accessibility for extermination and service animal considerations.</li> <li>Perform <b>common area monthly inspections</b> in stairwells, roof access areas, and sidewalks to catch seasonal pests like summer roaches and winter rodents.</li> <li>Schedule <b>bed bug dog sweeps bi-annually</b>, especially in studio apartments, family dwellings, and senior housing.</li> <li>Implement an <b>annual crack/caulk program</b> with sealing cracks, window screens, and garbage disposal rules for pest prevention.</li> <li>Follow a 311 response SOP for prompt action on service requests, tenant complaints, and re-infestation protocols.</li></ul> <h3>Compliance Checklist Template</h3><img alt="Compliance Checklist Template" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/how-often-must-nyc-landlords-exterminate(homg)_4.jpeg"/> <table><thead><tr><th>Task</th><th>Frequency</th><th>Documentation Required</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Use NYS DEC-licensed exterminators</td><td>Every treatment</td><td>License copy, service reports</td><td><input type="checkbox"/></td></tr> <tr><td>Maintain digital extermination logs</td><td>After each visit</td><td>Orkin-format logs, photos</td><td><input type="checkbox"/></td></tr> <tr><td>Quarterly IPM audits</td><td>Every 3 months</td><td>Audit reports, findings</td><td><input type="checkbox"/></td></tr> <tr><td>Pre/post-treatment notices</td><td>48 hours advance</td><td>Signed tenant receipts</td><td><input type="checkbox"/></td></tr> <tr><td>Common area inspections</td><td>Monthly</td><td>Inspection checklists</td><td><input type="checkbox"/></td></tr> <tr><td>Bed bug dog sweeps</td><td>Bi-annually</td><td>Sweep reports, certifications</td><td><input type="checkbox"/></td></tr> <tr><td>Crack/caulk program</td><td>Annually</td><td>Before/after photos</td><td><input type="checkbox"/></td></tr> <tr><td>311 response SOP</td><td>As received</td><td>Response logs, timelines</td><td><input type="checkbox"/></td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Use this <b>checklist template</b> for property management and building superintendents. It helps track compliance with Section 27-2017 HMC, avoiding class C violations and fines. Customize for subsidized housing, Section 8 vouchers, or immigrant communities.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>How Often Must NYC Landlords Exterminate?</h3> <p>In New York City, landlords are not required to perform preventative extermination on a fixed schedule like monthly or quarterly. However, under NYC Housing Maintenance Code Section 27-2017, landlords must exterminate whenever there is evidence of pests, such as bedbugs, roaches, or rodents, and keep units pest-free. Tenants should report issues promptly for immediate action.</p> <h3>What Triggers Mandatory Extermination for NYC Landlords?</h3> <p>How Often Must NYC Landlords Exterminate? Extermination is required as needed upon tenant complaints or visible infestations. NYC law mandates landlords address pest issues within a reasonable time, typically 7-14 days for bedbugs after notification, per Local Law 69 and HPD guidelines, to maintain habitable conditions.</p> <h3>Are There Scheduled Extermination Requirements for NYC Rental Properties?</h3> <p>How Often Must NYC Landlords Exterminate? No, there is no mandated frequency for routine extermination in standard rental units. Requirements kick in reactively-landlords must respond to verified infestations. For bedbugs specifically, annual inspections are recommended but not legally required unless specified in the lease.</p> <h3>How Often Must NYC Landlords Exterminate for Bedbugs?</h3> <p>How Often Must NYC Landlords Exterminate? Bedbug extermination must occur upon discovery or tenant report, with NYC requiring documentation and professional treatment within 7 days for active infestations (per HPD and DOB rules). Follow-up treatments may be needed every 2-4 weeks until eradication, but no proactive schedule is enforced.</p> <h3>What Are the Penalties if NYC Landlords Fail to Exterminate Timely?</h3> <p>How Often Must NYC Landlords Exterminate? Non-compliance can lead to HPD violations, fines up to $250 per day for ongoing issues, class C violations for pests, and potential tenant lawsuits for lease breaches. Landlords must exterminate promptly to avoid emergency repairs classifications and higher penalties.</p> <h3>Can Tenants Demand Monthly Exterminations from NYC Landlords?</h3> <p>How Often Must NYC Landlords Exterminate? Tenants cannot legally demand routine monthly extermination without a lease clause specifying it. NYC code requires only as-needed service for infestations. However, some buildings include quarterly treatments voluntarily; check your lease or negotiate for preventative measures.</p>
