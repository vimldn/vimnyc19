<p>Imagine unpacking your boxes only to find <b>rat droppings</b> in the kitchen-what a nightmare!</p> <p>Spotting a rodent problem before moving in saves you headaches, health risks, and hefty extermination bills. We'll cover spotting droppings, gnaw marks, <i>nocturnal scratches</i>, nests, grease trails, and more-from trash checks to asking residents. Plus, when to call pros. Ready to inspect like a detective?</p><h2>Why Check for Rodents Before Moving In</h2><img alt="Why Check for Rodents Before Moving In" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/how-do-i-know-if-my-building-has-a-rodent-problem-before-i-move-in(82ub)_1.jpeg"/> <p>A 2023 CDC report documented 5,000+ hantavirus cases linked to rodent-infested homes, with 36% occurring in newly moved-in families who skipped pre-move inspections. Rodents carry serious <b>disease risks</b> like hantavirus, salmonella, and leptospirosis. Early detection during a <b>pre-move-in check</b> protects your health and belongings.</p> <p>Skipping a <b>rodent inspection</b> exposes you to property damage from gnaw marks on wires and walls. Rodents contaminate food and trigger allergens that worsen asthma. Children and pets face higher risks from <b>droppings identification</b> and urine exposure in hidden areas.</p> <p>Here are four key risks of ignoring <b>signs of rodents</b> before moving in:</p> <ul><li><b>Disease transmission</b>: Rodents spread hantavirus through droppings and urine, posing severe health threats to new residents.</li> <li><b>Property damage</b>: Chewing on insulation and wiring leads to costly repairs and potential fire hazards.</li> <li><b>Family safety</b>: Kids and pets encounter higher exposure in kitchens and play areas with active infestations.</li> <li><b>Legal costs</b>: Undisclosed rodent problems can result in disputes with landlords over habitability issues.</li></ul> <p>Consider an Ohio family who moved into an apartment with hidden <b>rodent infestation</b>. They faced leptospirosis from contaminated water, leading to major medical bills. A simple $150 <b>pest inspection</b> could have revealed nests and prevented thousands in damages and health costs.</p> <h2>Understanding Common Rodent Signs</h2> <p>Rodent signs fall into <b>5 distinct categories</b> recognized by pest management experts. These include droppings and urine spots, gnaw marks and damage, nests and greasy rub marks, tracks and burrow holes, and unusual noises or pet reactions. Early detection during a pre-move-in check helps spot a rodent problem before it worsens.</p> <p>Inspectors often focus on these <b>common indicators</b> in high-risk areas like kitchens, attics, and basements. Look for fresh evidence of <b>rodent activity</b> such as shiny droppings or recent chew marks. This building inspection step protects your family from health concerns like disease risk and fire hazards.</p> <p>Experts recommend a thorough <b>visual inspection</b> of the building exterior, foundation cracks, and entry points. Check for overgrown vegetation or debris piles that attract rodents. Addressing these telltale signs early prevents a full rodent infestation.</p> <p>Combine DIY checks with pet reactions, like dog barking or cat alertness, for better results. Neighbor complaints or landlord disclosure in the lease agreement can also reveal past issues. Use this moving checklist to guide your <b>home inspection</b>.</p> <h3>Droppings and Urine Spots</h3> <p>House mouse droppings measure <b>3-6mm</b> (rice-sized), while Norway rat pellets reach 12-20mm (jellybean-sized). Roof rat droppings are spindle-shaped with a banana-like curve. Fresh droppings appear shiny and black, signaling active infestation within 24-48 hours, while old ones turn dusty gray.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Rodent Type</th><th>Size</th><th>Shape</th><th>Daily Output</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>House Mouse</td><td>3-6mm</td><td>Pointed ends</td><td>50+</td></tr> <tr><td>Roof Rat</td><td>12-15mm</td><td>Spindle, curved</td><td>40+</td></tr> <tr><td>Norway Rat</td><td>20mm</td><td>Blunt, capsule</td><td>30+</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Spot <b>fecal pellets</b> along walls, in cabinets, or near stored food. An <b>ammonia smell test</b> detects urine in hidden spots, often near chewed packaging or food contamination. Rent a UV blacklight to reveal fluorescent rodent urine trails in dark areas like wall voids.</p> <p>During your <b>attic inspection</b> or basement check, sweep droppings into a bag for safe disposal. Wear gloves to avoid allergen exposure or diseases like salmonella. This droppings identification confirms mice signs or rat signs quickly.</p> <h3>Gnaw Marks and Damage</h3> <p>Rats gnaw <b>1-2 inch marks</b> with rough parallel grooves, while mice leave 1/8 inch angled scratches. Expect multiple chew sites on baseboards, kitchen cabinets, and attic joists. Rodents target wood, insulation, cardboard, and wiring for nesting and survival.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Rodent Type</th><th>Mark Description</th><th>Common Locations</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Mouse</td><td>Fine 1/8 inch scratches</td><td>Cardboard, wiring</td></tr> <tr><td>Rat</td><td>2cm deep grooves</td><td>Wood, insulation</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Chewed wiring poses a <b>fire hazard</b>, a key concern in apartments or multi-unit dwellings. Inspect pantry shelves for gnaw marks on food bags and boxes. <b>Insulation damage</b> appears as shredded bits scattered around.</p> <p>Check doors, windows, and vents for <b>chew marks</b> indicating entry points. Norway rats prefer ground-level damage, while roof rats hit higher spots. Seal gaps and cracks to stop <b>rodent pathways</b> during your pre-move-in rodent-proofing.</p> <h2>Listen for Nocturnal Activity</h2> <p>Peak rodent activity hits 10pm-2am per University of Florida Entomology studies, producing 85-110 decibels of scratching (toaster volume). These <b>unusual noises</b> signal a potential rodent problem during your pre-move-in check. Listening at night reveals signs of rodents like mice or rats moving in hidden areas.</p> <p>Focus on <b>scratching sounds</b> from wall voids, scurry noises in attics, gnawing on joists, and rustling from nest building. Use a phone app like Decibel X to record at 11pm for 15 minutes. This helps confirm if noises match rodent infestation patterns.</p> <p>Record in quiet conditions to capture clear audio. Compare recordings to examples like <i>sharp claw scrapes</i> or <i>quick pattering feet</i>. Persistent sounds indicate active night activity and the need for further building inspection.</p> <h3>Common Rodent Sound Types</h3> <ul><li><b>Scratching walls</b> at 85dB in wall voids sounds like nails dragging on wood, often from rats foraging.</li> <li><b>Scurrying floors</b> at 75dB in attics mimics light footsteps racing across beams, typical of house mice.</li> <li><b>Gnawing wood</b> at 95dB on joists creates rhythmic chewing like tearing paper, a sign of roof rats.</li> <li><b>Nest building rustles</b> at 65dB involves soft shuffling of debris, common in hidden nests.</li></ul> <h3>Recording and Timing Chart</h3> <p>Set up your phone with Decibel X in suspected areas like the attic or basement. Record for 15 minutes starting at 11pm when rodents are most active. Note peaks above 65dB as potential red flags for rodent pathways.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Time Slot</th><th>Expected Activity</th><th>Decibel Range</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>10pm-11pm</td><td>Initial movement</td><td>65-85dB</td><td>Start recording</td></tr> <tr><td>11pm-12am</td><td>Peak foraging</td><td>85-95dB</td><td>Monitor scratching</td></tr> <tr><td>12am-1am</td><td>Gnawing and scurrying</td><td>75-110dB</td><td>Check for patterns</td></tr> <tr><td>1am-2am</td><td>Nest rustles</td><td>65-85dB</td><td>End session, review</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Review audio for <b>telltale signs</b> like repetitive gnaw marks sounds paired with visual checks for droppings. Combine with pet reactions, such as dog barking at walls, for early detection. If confirmed, consider professional pest control before moving in.</p> <h2>Inspect for Nests and Entry Points</h2><img alt="Inspect for Nests and Entry Points" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/how-do-i-know-if-my-building-has-a-rodent-problem-before-i-move-in(82ub)_2.jpeg"/> <p>Research suggests <b>nests</b> often hide in attics during inspections, while tiny gaps let rodents slip inside. Experts recommend checking for <b>entry points</b> around doors, vents, and foundations before moving in. This pre-move-in check reveals signs of rodents early.</p> <p>Start your <b>building inspection</b> outdoors, scanning the foundation for cracks and overgrown vegetation near walls. Rodents favor debris piles and garbage areas as pathways. Look for burrow holes or greasy rub marks along these spots.</p> <p>Indoors, focus on nesting hotspots like wall voids and crawlspaces. Use a flashlight to spot droppings, gnaw marks, or <i>shredded paper balls</i> in insulation. Sealing gaps with steel wool and caulk prevents future access.</p> <p>Common <b>nests detection</b> involves seasonal peaks in winter when rodents seek warmth. Check for unusual noises like scratching at night. If pet reactions or ammonia smells appear, call for professional pest control.</p> <h3>Common Nesting Areas</h3> <p>Check <b>attic insulation</b> first. Research suggests many nests hide there, identifiable by 4-8 inch shredded paper balls with mouse hairs. Pull back insulation gently to inspect without disturbing too much.</p> <p>Prioritize these top areas during your pre-move-in check:</p> <ul><li>Attic insulation for softball-sized clumps of fibers and droppings</li> <li>Wall voids behind cabinets, revealed by chew marks on wood</li> <li>Basement storage boxes with grass or fabric nests inside</li> <li>Kitchen drawers holding small paper balls or fecal pellets</li> <li>Garage clutter piled with shredded materials and rub marks</li> <li>Crawlspaces showing burrow holes and paw prints</li> <li>HVAC returns with debris and greasy tracks nearby</li></ul> <p>Mouse nests measure 3-6 inches, often using grass or paper. Rat nests reach 12-18 inches with shredded fabric. <b>Seasonal activity</b> peaks in winter for warmth and breeding season in spring.</p> <p>Spot signs of rodents like fresh shiny droppings versus dusty old ones. Listen for scurrying noises at night from active infestations. Early detection in these spots avoids health risks like disease from urine or allergens.</p> <h2>Check for Grease Trails and Rub Marks</h2> <p>Roof rats leave 1-3mm wide greasy trails along most travel paths, visible as darkened smudges on beams per Terminix field guides. These <b>grease trails</b> and rub marks form from body oils as rodents brush against surfaces repeatedly. Spotting them during a building inspection reveals active rodent pathways.</p> <p>Mice create <b>pencil-thin trails</b> about 1mm wide with light brown residue, while rats leave finger-wide marks around 3mm with black oily smears. Check common spots like along walls, overhead beams, and pipes during your pre-move-in check. These greasy marks indicate frequent rodent travel.</p> <p>To detect them, wipe suspected areas with a <b>white cloth</b>; brown or black residue confirms signs of rodents. Trails darken after about 72 hours, showing fresh activity if shiny and dark. Map paths by connecting three or more marks to identify an active run.</p> <p>Focus on <b>high-risk areas</b> such as attic inspections, basement rodents zones, and wall voids. Combine this with checks for droppings identification, gnaw marks, and nests detection. Early spotting of these rub marks helps assess rodent infestation risks before moving in.</p> <h2>Examine the Trash and Food Areas</h2> <p>Inspect pantry shelves for gnaw-through cereal boxes. Experts note that <b>food packaging damage</b> often signals a <b>rodent problem</b>. Look for chew marks on boxes and bags during your pre-move-in check.</p> <p>Check pet food bags and trash cans next. <b>Signs of rodents</b> like scattered crumbs or greasy residue around these spots indicate frequent visits. Open every container to spot hidden <i>chewed edges</i> or droppings.</p> <p>Examine sink cabinets, fridge gaskets, drawers, and upper cabinets in a systematic <b>7-point kitchen inspection</b>. Rodents target these high-risk areas for stored food. Finding even a few fecal pellets means potential rodent infestation.</p> <p>See more than <b>10 pellets</b> in one area? This suggests active contamination from mice or rats. Use this threshold during your building inspection to assess food safety risks before signing the lease.</p> <h3>Follow This 7-Point Kitchen Inspection Checklist</h3> <p>Start with <b>cereal boxes</b> on pantry shelves for gnaw marks or holes. Move to <b>pet food bags</b>, checking for tears and spillage. Then inspect trash cans for scattered debris and <i>rice-sized droppings</i>.</p> <ul><li>Sink cabinets: Look under pipes for nests or urine stains.</li> <li>Fridge gaskets: Pull and check for chew damage or greasy rub marks.</li> <li>Drawers: Empty them to find shredded paper or fecal pellets.</li> <li>Cabinets: Peer into corners for <b>chewed packaging</b> and musty odors.</li></ul> <p>Perform this list during your <b>DIY inspection</b>. Fresh, shiny droppings point to current rodent activity, while dusty ones suggest older issues.</p> <h3>Spot Contamination and Droppings</h3> <p>Identify fecal pellets by size and shape during your check. Mouse droppings resemble black rice grains, while rat ones are larger like jellybeans. Count them in food zones to gauge infestation level.</p> <p>A threshold of 10+ pellets signals active problems needing attention. Check for gnaw marks on wood or plastic, and sniff for ammonia-like <b>rodent urine</b> smells. These are telltale <b>mice signs</b> or rat signs.</p> <p>Use a blacklight for glowing urine trails on surfaces. Combine with greasy <b>rub marks</b> along walls for clear evidence. This helps in droppings identification and early detection.</p> <h3>Safe Food Storage Tips</h3> <p>Store food in <b>metal containers</b> to prevent access, unlike plastic ones rodents easily chew. Experts recommend airtight metal cans for pantry items. This reduces <b>food contamination</b> risks post-move-in.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Container Type</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Metal</td><td>Durable, rodent-proof</td><td>Heavier to handle</td></tr> <tr><td>Plastic</td><td>Lightweight, clear view</td><td>Easily gnawed through</td></tr> <tr><td>Glass</td><td>Non-porous, sealable</td><td>Breakable if dropped</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Seal gaps around storage areas too. Proper choices protect against chewed packaging and support <b>rodent-proofing</b>. Integrate into your moving checklist for family safety.</p> <h2>Outdoor Indicators Around the Building</h2><img alt="Outdoor Indicators Around the Building" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/how-do-i-know-if-my-building-has-a-rodent-problem-before-i-move-in(82ub)_3.jpeg"/> <p>Foundation cracks wider than <i>1/4 inch</i> often serve as entry points for <b>Norway rats</b> during a building inspection. These gaps allow rodents to squeeze through easily. Look for them along the base of walls and around utility pipes.</p> <p>Check for <b>burrow holes</b> near the foundation, typically 2 to 4 inches wide for rats. Norway rats dig these entrances under porches or next to sidewalks. Fresh soil piles nearby signal active digging.</p> <p>Overgrown vegetation touching the building creates hiding spots and rodent pathways. Trim bushes and shrubs to maintain a <b>3-foot clearance</b> from walls. This simple step reduces attraction for mice and rats seeking cover.</p> <ul><li>Inspect <b>debris piles</b> like stacked wood or leaves against the exterior, as they harbor nests.</li> <li>Examine <b>garbage areas</b> for overflow, which draws rodents with food scents.</li> <li>Spot <b>tracks identification</b>: mouse paw prints about 1 cm, rat prints around 2.5 cm with tail drags in dust or mud.</li></ul> <p>During your pre-move-in check, walk the perimeter at dusk when rodent activity peaks. Note any <b>greasy marks</b> or rub marks on walls from frequent travel. These outdoor signs of rodents warn of potential infestation inside.</p> <h2>Ask the Right Questions to Current Residents</h2> <p>California Civil Code 1940.7 mandates <b>landlord pest disclosure</b>. Renters often overlook this requirement during the pre-move-in check. Asking current residents directly uncovers hidden signs of rodents.</p> <p>Prepare a list of <b>targeted questions</b> to spot a potential rodent problem. Look for yes answers as red flags indicating active infestation. These conversations reveal issues missed in official reports.</p> <p>Follow up with neighbors in <b>multi-unit dwellings</b> for broader insights. Note patterns like shared wall voids or basement rodents. This approach aids <b>early detection</b> before signing a lease.</p> <p>Use a polite script to build rapport. For example, say, <i>"I'm considering moving here and want to know about any pest issues you've noticed."</i> Document responses for your <b>moving checklist</b>.</p> <h3>12 Targeted Questions with Red Flags</h3> <p>Ask these <b>12 targeted questions</b> to current residents or neighbors. Each yes signals a rodent infestation risk. Pay attention to details like droppings identification or unusual noises.</p> <ul><li>Have you seen <b>rodent droppings</b>? Yes is an <b>immediate red flag</b>; check for <i>shiny, fresh fecal pellets</i> near <b>pantry shelves</b>.</li> <li>Heard <b>scratching sounds at night</b>? This points to <b>night activity</b> from <b>house mice</b> or <b>roof rats</b>.</li> <li>Any <b>landlord pest history</b>? Request records under state disclosure laws.</li> <li>Neighbor <b>complaints about rodents</b>? Common in <b>apartment rodents</b> spreading via shared spaces.</li> <li>Are <b>trash areas</b> clean? Poor conditions attract Norway rats as a primary draw.</li> <li>Spotted <b>gnaw marks</b> or chew marks on wires or boxes? Indicates <b>insulation damage</b> and <b>fire hazards</b>.</li> <li>Noticed <b>greasy rub marks</b> along walls? <b>Rat signs</b> from oil in their fur on rodent pathways.</li> <li>Any <b>ammonia smell</b> or musty odors? Suggests rodent urine in attic inspection areas.</li> <li>Seen nests detection in cabinets or voids? Look for shredded paper or fabric.</li> <li>Pet reactions like <b>dog barking</b> or <b>cat alertness</b>? Animals sense <b>scurrying noises</b>.</li> <li>Chewed <b>food packaging</b> or <b>stored food contamination</b>? Classic mice signs.</li> <li>Evidence of entry points like <b>foundation cracks</b>? Check for <b>gaps sealing</b> needs.</li></ul> <h3>Legal Follow-Up Script</h3> <p>If answers raise concerns, use this legal follow-up script. It prompts official responses without confrontation. This protects your <b>family safety</b> and highlights <b>health concerns</b> like disease risk.</p> <p>Say: <i>"Thanks for the info. Can you direct me to the landlord for pest control records? I'm aware of disclosure laws and want to review any past rodent reports or professional pest control visits."</i> Follow with a written request if needed.</p> <p>Insist on a <b>pest report</b> in the lease agreement pests clause. Reference local laws for rodent-proofing responsibilities. This ensures transparency during your building inspection.</p> <h3>State-Specific Disclosure Laws</h3> <p>Landlords in many states must disclose known <b>rodent activity evidence</b>. Check your area's rules before moving. This table outlines key requirements for common states.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>State</th><th>Disclosure Requirement</th><th>Key Details</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>California</td><td>Civil Code 1940.7</td><td>Mandatory written notice of <b><a href="/blog/is-my-nyc-landlord-responsible-for-bed-bug-extermination">bed bug</a>s</b> and pests like rodents.</td></tr> <tr><td>New York</td><td>Multiple Dwelling Law</td><td>Requires reporting infestations; tenants can demand action.</td></tr> <tr><td>Illinois</td><td>Chicago RLTO</td><td>Landlord must treat pests within 14 days of notice.</td></tr> <tr><td>Florida</td><td>Statute 83.51</td><td>Landlord responsible for extermination of rats or mice.</td></tr> <tr><td>Texas</td><td>Property Code 92.056</td><td>Casualty loss includes pest infestations; repair required.</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Verify laws for your state via official resources. Experts recommend combining this with a DIY inspection or hiring a <b>rodent inspection service</b>. Spot telltale signs like paw prints or burrow holes early.</p> <h2>Professional Inspection Options</h2> <p>Orkin <b>thermal imaging inspections</b> detect more nest activity than visual checks alone, per independent lab tests. These advanced scans reveal heat signatures from <i>wall voids</i> and <b>attic inspections</b> where rodents hide. Homebuyers use them for thorough pre-move-in checks.</p> <p>Choose services based on your building type, like apartments or multi-unit dwellings prone to <b>roof rat</b> entry. Experts recommend combining methods for early detection of <i>droppings identification</i> and gnaw marks. This approach spots rodent pathways before signing a lease.</p> <p>A detailed pest report strengthens lease negotiations, highlighting entry points like foundation cracks. Inspectors check high-risk areas such as kitchen cabinets and basement rodents. Request coverage for disease risk like hantavirus from <i>fecal pellets</i>.</p> <p>Compare options to fit your budget and needs for rodent infestation confirmation. Local services offer basics, while national chains provide tech like <b>blacklight urine</b> detection. Always verify credentials before hiring for family safety.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Service</th><th>Cost</th><th>Key Method</th><th>Best For</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Orkin</td><td>$225</td><td>thermal imaging</td><td>nests detection in wall voids</td></tr> <tr><td>Terminix</td><td>$199</td><td>blacklight urine</td><td>rodent urine and rub marks</td></tr> <tr><td>Rentokil</td><td>$275</td><td>canine detection</td><td>hidden attic and basement rodents</td></tr> <tr><td>Local</td><td>$125</td><td>visual only</td><td>basic droppings and chew marks</td></tr> <tr><td>DIY</td><td>$35 UV light</td><td>UV inspection</td><td>quick greasy marks check</td></tr></tbody></table> <h3>Certification Checklist</h3> <p>Verify if the rodent inspection service is an NPMA member for reliable standards. Look for 5+ years of experience in <b>pest control</b>. Confirm thermal capability for advanced signs of rodents.</p> <p>Check licenses and insurance to protect against liability during building inspection. Ask about training in <b>species identification</b>, like house mouse versus Norway rat droppings. This ensures accurate tracks identification.</p> <p>A certified team spots <i>burrow holes</i> and <b>paw prints</b> missed by amateurs. They assess <b>seasonal rodent activity</b>, such as winter infestations. Use this list to select pros for prevention tips.</p> <ul><li>NPMA membership or equivalent certification</li> <li>At least 5 years in rodent control</li> <li>Thermal imaging or canine tools available</li> <li>State pest control license</li> <li>Insurance for on-site work</li></ul> <h3>Report Requirements for Lease Negotiations</h3><img alt="Report Requirements for Lease Negotiations" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/how-do-i-know-if-my-building-has-a-rodent-problem-before-i-move-in(82ub)_4.jpeg"/> <p>Demand a written pest report detailing rodent activity evidence, like fresh versus old droppings. Include photos of nests detection and recommendations for gaps sealing. This supports requests for repairs before move-in.</p> <p>Specify coverage of entry points, vents screening, and building exterior checks. Note any health concerns from allergens or wiring chew fire hazards. Landlords must address per <b>lease agreement pests</b> clauses.</p> <p>For multi-unit dwellings, require neighbor complaint reviews and <b>landlord disclosure</b>. Highlight insulation damage and food contamination risks. A strong report aids moving checklist and rent reductions if needed.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>How Do I Know If My Building Has a Rodent Problem Before I Move In?</h3> <p>To determine if a building has a rodent problem before moving in, inspect for droppings, gnaw marks on walls or wires, greasy rub marks along baseboards, unusual pet behavior, or musty odors. Check common areas like basements, attics, and trash zones during a walkthrough, and ask the landlord or previous tenants about pest history.</p> <h3>What Are the Most Common Signs of Rodents in a Building Before Moving In?</h3> <p>Common signs include small, dark droppings (rice-sized for mice, larger for rats), nests made from shredded paper or fabric, chewed food packaging, and scratchy noises at night. When checking how do I know if my building has a rodent problem before I move in, focus on these during an in-person inspection.</p> <h3>How Can I Spot Rodent Droppings to Check for a Problem Before Moving In?</h3> <p>Rodent droppings are a key indicator: mouse droppings are tiny (3-6mm), pointed, and black; rat droppings are larger (12-20mm), capsule-shaped. Look in cabinets, corners, and along walls. If you find fresh, moist ones while asking how do I know if my building has a rodent problem before I move in, it's a red flag.</p> <h3>Should I Inspect the Attic or Basement for Rodents Before Moving In?</h3> <p>Yes, attics and basements are prime rodent hotspots.
