Checking violations upfront could have saved renters like Maria $2,400 in deposit losses from a <i>mold-infested Brooklyn walk-up</i>. She signed a lease without a <b>violation lookup NYC</b> and later discovered undisclosed Class B violations.</p> <p>Maria's landlord refused to return her deposit, claiming the issues predated her tenancy. <b>HPD violations</b> like mold often lead to tenant disputes and financial losses. Always perform an <b>apartment violations check</b> before lease signing to avoid similar problems.</p> <ul><li><b>Hazardous conditions</b> such as <i>lead paint Class C violations</i> pose serious health risks to families, especially children.</li> <li><b>Rent overcharges</b> happen in illegal units like <i>cellar apartments</i> that violate NYC housing codes.</li> <li><b>Eviction delays</b> occur when open violations block landlord actions during tenant disputes.</li> <li><b>Health issues</b> from mold, lack of heat, or pests affect daily living and require immediate fixes.</li></ul> <p>Properties with multiple violations often rent below market rates, as noted in recent StreetEasy reports.
