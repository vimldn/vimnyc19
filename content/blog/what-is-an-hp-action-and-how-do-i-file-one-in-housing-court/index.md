<p>Stuck with a leaky ceiling, faulty heat, or other hazards your landlord ignores? An <b>HP Action</b> in housing court could be your ticket to repairs-and justice.</p> <p>This powerful tenant tool levels the playing field against neglectful owners, backed by New York City's Housing Maintenance Code.</p> <p>Discover what it is, when to file, step-by-step prep and process, plus outcomes and free legal aid to get your home fixed fast.</p><h2>What Is an HP Action?</h2><img alt="What Is an HP Action?" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/what-is-an-hp-action-and-how-do-i-file-one-in-housing-court(8f48)_1.jpeg"/> <p>An HP Action (Housing Part Action) is a tenant-initiated <b>summary proceeding</b> in NYC Housing Court to enforce landlord repairs for Housing Maintenance Code violations. Tenants use it to force landlords to fix serious issues like no heat or pests through court orders. This process addresses <b>landlord tenant disputes</b> quickly in NYC Housing Court.</p> <p>HP Actions target violations reported to the <b>Housing Preservation Department</b> (HPD) that landlords ignore. For example, if heat drops below 68 degreesF in winter, tenants can seek a court order for repairs. This differs from holdover or nonpayment petitions by focusing on <b>habitability breach</b> rather than eviction.</p> <p>Courts may grant <b>rent abatement</b>, appoint an administrator, or impose penalties in an HP Action. Tenants file after documenting HPD violations via 311 calls. This tool protects <b>tenant rights</b> against illegal lockout or constructive eviction.</p> <p>Understanding HP Actions helps in broader <b>eviction proceedings</b> like nuisance holdover or chronic nonpayment cases. It give the power tos pro se litigants with court forms from the housing court clerk. Always track the <b>HP docket</b> for updates.</p> <h3>Legal Definition and Purpose</h3> <p>Under NYC Civil Court Act 110(a), an HP Action lets tenants sue landlords in Housing Court for court-ordered repairs when Housing Maintenance Code violations threaten health or safety. It draws from NYC Administrative Code 27-2005 and Multiple Dwelling Law. This summary proceeding ensures swift enforcement of landlord obligations.</p> <p>The main purposes include four key outcomes. First, courts issue an <b>order to correct violations</b>. Second, they provide rent abatement for lost use of the apartment. Third, civil penalties range from $250 to $2000 per violation. Fourth, judges appoint an administrator if needed.</p> <p>Consider this basic flowchart for the <b>HP action process</b>: Report violation to HPD via 311, receive an <b>HPD violation</b> and Order to Correct, wait for no fix, then file HP. For instance, a <i>lead paint hazard</i> triggers this path. Tenants strengthen cases with proof of service and tenant affidavits.</p> <p>HP judges oversee these in Housing Part, distinct from nonpayment or holdover petitions. Pro se litigants use court forms for <b>petition filing</b>. This upholds tenant rights in rent-stabilized apartments or Section 8 cases.</p> <h3>When Tenants Should File</h3> <p>File HP Action when landlord ignores <b>HPD violations</b> for 21+ days after Order to Correct, especially Class B/C hazards like no heat below 68 degreesF, pests, or leaks. Always document 311 calls first. This starts the <b>steps to file HP</b> in NYC Housing Court.</p> <p>Use this decision table to guide timing:</p> <table><thead><tr><th><b>Violation Type</b></th><th><b>Wait Period</b></th><th><b>File HP?</b></th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Class A (e.g., paint chips)</td><td>Monitor</td><td>No, unless ongoing</td></tr> <tr><td>Class B (e.g., no hot water)</td><td>21 days</td><td>Yes</td></tr> <tr><td>Class C (e.g., no heat)</td><td>24 hours</td><td>Immediate</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Class C issues like <i>pest infestation</i> demand quick action beyond the Emergency Repair Program, which caps at $5000. Log all 311 interactions for your <b>housing court answers</b>. Check HPD inspector reports for <b>building code violations</b>.</p> <p>Avoid repair and deduct for major hazards; pursue HP instead. Combine with harassment claims or retaliatory eviction defenses. Seek housing court navigator or legal aid for <b>court appearance</b> prep, especially in rent control or public housing.</p> <h2>HP Action vs. Other Housing Cases</h2> <p><b>HP Actions differ from nonpayment and holdover petitions</b> because tenants initiate them to force repairs, not defend against eviction. In a <b>housing court</b> setting, landlords typically file nonpayment or holdover cases to recover rent or end tenancies. Tenants use HP actions to address <i>housing maintenance code violations</i> like leaks or pests.</p> <p>Understanding these distinctions helps tenants choose the right <b>court filing</b>. For example, if a landlord sues for unpaid rent, a tenant might file an <b>HP counterclaim</b> alleging habitability issues. This hybrid approach combines defense with demands for fixes.</p> <p>Each case type follows a unique HP action timeline and process in <b>NYC housing court</b>. Filing fees remain consistent at $45 across them, but outcomes vary from repair orders to eviction warrants. Tenants should review <b>court forms</b> on the NYS courts website before proceeding.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>HP Action</th><th>Nonpayment</th><th>Holdover</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Who Files</td><td>Tenant files</td><td>Landlord files</td><td>Landlord files</td></tr> <tr><td>Main Goal</td><td>Repairs ordered</td><td>Rent owed</td><td>Tenancy ends</td></tr> <tr><td>Filing Fee</td><td>$45</td><td>$45</td><td>$45</td></tr> <tr><td>Timeline</td><td>30-60 days</td><td>14-30 days</td><td>30-90 days</td></tr> <tr><td>Example Issue</td><td>Pest infestation</td><td>Rent arrears</td><td>Lease expiration</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>In practice, a tenant facing a nonpayment petition can raise an <b>affirmative defense</b> of poor conditions and counterclaim with an HP action. This strategy often leads to stipulations for repairs alongside payment plans. Consulting a <b>housing court navigator</b> clarifies these options.</p> <h2>Preparing to File an HP Action</h2> <p>Proper preparation wins most <b>HP actions</b> in NYC Housing Court. Document everything before filing at <b>111 Centre Street</b>. Evidence collection takes 1-2 hours but determines case success.</p> <p>Start by gathering proof of <b>housing maintenance code violations</b>. This includes HPD violations and photos. Strong evidence supports your tenant rights against landlord obligations.</p> <p>Next, collect required forms like the <b>HP-1 petition</b>. File with the housing court clerk and pay court filing fees. Proper <b>service of process</b> avoids rejection.</p> <p>Review your lease for breaches like <b>habitability issues</b>. Note any <b>notice to cure</b> or 311 logs. This preparation strengthens your position in the HP action process.</p> <h3>Gathering Evidence</h3><img alt="Gathering Evidence" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/what-is-an-hp-action-and-how-do-i-file-one-in-housing-court(8f48)_2.jpeg"/> <p>Collect 7 specific pieces of evidence: HPD violation documents, timestamped photos/videos, <b>311 call logs</b>, neighbor statements, and utility bills showing service interruptions.
