The area traces its roots to 1850s housing for workers, transformed by 1960s beatniks and 1970s punk scenes where CBGB hosted the Ramones' debut. Gentrification in the 1990s brought new energy while preserving its edgy spirit.</p> <p>Today, the <b>neighborhood vibe</b> blends street art on every block with St. Marks Place as hipster central. The New Museum's 2004 exhibit <i>East Village USA</i> captured this artistic legacy.
