<p>Ever filed a complaint with <b>HPD</b> and then... crickets? You're not alone-many tenants wonder what happens next in New York City's housing maze.</p> <p>This guide breaks it down: from confirmation receipt and inspector assignment, through site visits, violation notices, and enforcement if landlords drag their feet. Stick around to know exactly what to expect and how to stay on top of it!</p><h3>Confirmation Receipt</h3><img alt="Confirmation Receipt" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/what-happens-after-i-file-a-complaint-with-hpd(oej3)_1.jpeg"/> <p>Your confirmation email or SMS includes a <b>9-digit case number</b> in the format <i>HPD1234567</i> and login details for myHPD.nyc.gov where tenants track their HPD complaint status after filing. This number serves as your primary reference for all follow-ups on the <b>HPD process</b>. Save it immediately for easy access.</p> <p>To check your <b>complaint status</b> on the myHPD portal, follow these steps: first, visit myHPD.nyc.gov. Next, enter your <b>case number</b> along with the email or phone used during complaint filing. Then, view the detailed status, such as Open, Assigned, or Closed.</p> <p>The dashboard typically shows a screenshot-like view with <b>Complaint Status: Under Review</b> highlighted, including timestamps for filing date, last update, and assigned inspector. This helps tenants monitor the <b>investigation timeline</b> without calling. Key details like violation type, such as <i>heat complaint</i> or <i>pest infestation</i>, appear alongside.</p> <p>Here are three common <b>complaint statuses</b> and their meanings:</p> <ul><li><b>Open</b>: The housing complaint is received and logged, awaiting initial review or assignment to an <b>HPD inspector</b>. For example, a new <i>hot water issue</i> stays Open until verified.</li> <li><b>Assigned</b>: An inspector is scheduled for a <b>site visit</b> to check code violations like <i>mold remediation</i>. This stage includes details on the <b>inspection process</b> and expected HPD response time.</li> <li><b>Closed</b>: The case ends after <b>violation correction</b>, reinspection, or compliance certificate issuance. An example is a resolved <i>rodent control</i> issue with proof of extermination.</li></ul> <h3>Initial Assessment</h3> <p>HPD classifies violations into Class A (14-day response, e.g., no heat below 62 degreesF), Class B (30 days, e.g., leaks), Class C (120 days, e.g., peeling paint) based on NYC Housing Maintenance Code Table 1. After you <b>file a complaint</b> with HPD, the agency reviews it quickly to assign a class. This determines the <b>HPD response time</b> and sets expectations for the inspection process.</p> <p>The <b>scoring system</b> assigns points based on violation severity and location. Higher points for immediate health risks like <i>gas leaks</i> push cases to Class A. Location in kitchens or bathrooms adds points due to daily impact.</p> <p>Consider case <b>#HPD7890123</b>, a heat complaint in winter. It scored high for severity in a bedroom, earning Class A status. HPD scheduled an HPD inspector visit within days, issuing a violation notice to the landlord.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Violation Type</th><th>Response Time</th><th>Examples</th><th>Legal Basis</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Class A</td><td>14 days</td><td><ul><li>Heat complaint (no heat below 62 degreesF)</li><li>Hot water issue</li><li>Pest infestation</li><li>Lead paint hazard</li><li>Boiler breakdown</li></ul></td><td>NYC Housing Maintenance Code Table 1 (immediate hazards)</td></tr> <tr><td>Class B</td><td>30 days</td><td><ul><li>Mold remediation</li><li>Window repair</li><li>Door lock issues</li><li>Bathroom fixture leaks</li><li>Rodent control</li></ul></td><td>NYC Housing Maintenance Code Table 1 (health risks)</td></tr> <tr><td>Class C</td><td>120 days</td><td><ul><li>Peeling paint</li><li>Kitchen appliance faults</li><li>Minor structural issues</li><li>Extermination service delays</li><li>General building violations</li></ul></td><td>NYC Housing Maintenance Code Table 1 (maintenance needs)</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Use the myHPD portal or 311 service to check your complaint status after filing. Document evidence like photos for complaint verification. This helps during the initial assessment and any <b>follow-up status</b> checks.</p> <h3>Inspector Assignment</h3> <p>Your <b>HPD complaint</b> routes to 1 of 5 borough HPD Field Operations offices. Manhattan gets 35% of assignments per 2023 HPD Annual Report. Expect <b>inspector contact</b> within 5 days.</p> <p>HPD assigns inspectors based on a simple <b>assignment algorithm</b>. This uses your zip code and violation type, like a <i>heat complaint</i> or <b>pest infestation</b>. It ensures the right HPD field office handles local issues quickly.</p> <p>Inspectors must pass the <b>NYC Civil Service Exam #6042</b>. They manage an average caseload of 45 inspections per week. Contact comes as a call or email from Inspector John Doe, Badge #1234, with your case number.</p> <ul><li>Bronx: 346 Broadway, Bronx, NY 10473, (718) 579-2400</li> <li>Brooklyn: 345 Adams St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, (718) 722-3000</li> <li>Manhattan: 100 Gold St, New York, NY 10038, (212) 863-6300</li> <li>Queens: 74-03 Commonwealth Blvd, Jamaica, NY 11426, (718) 557-6400</li> <li>Staten Island: 361 Union Ave, Staten Island, NY 10303, (718) 420-4300</li></ul> <p>After assignment, the HPD inspector verifies your housing complaint. Prepare photos or witness statements for the site visit. This starts the inspection process for issues like <i>lead paint hazards</i> or <b>class B violations</b>.</p> <h3>Scheduling the Visit</h3> <p>Inspectors call within <b>3 days of assignment</b> using the 311 callback system. Answer unknown numbers showing <b>646-556-9###</b>, the HPD exchange. This starts the HPD investigation after your complaint filing.</p> <p>Prepare for the site visit with these numbered steps to ensure smooth inspection process. Follow them to support <b>complaint verification</b> and protect your tenant rights.</p> <ol><li>Clear access to the unit and problem areas. Notify the <b>building superintendent</b> or managing agent <b>48 hours prior</b> to avoid delays in the HPD process.</li> <li>Document conditions with <b>timestamped photos</b>. Capture issues like <i>pest infestation</i> or <i>hot water issues</i> for evidence during the visit.</li> <li>Prepare a <b>violation list</b> with NYC Housing Code citations. Reference sections on <i>heat complaints</i> or <i>mold remediation</i> to guide the HPD inspector.</li> <li>Have your <b>lease</b> and HPD case number ready. Check status via the <b>myHPD portal</b> or 311 service beforehand.</li></ol> <p>HPD allows 2 attempts max for scheduling the visit. A no-show leads to <b>case closure</b>, so confirm promptly to keep your <b>housing complaint</b> active and push for violation notice.</p> <p>If rescheduling occurs, document reasons like <i>boiler breakdown</i> emergencies. This helps with follow-up status and avoids open violations turning into closed cases without action.</p> <h3>Findings Report</h3> <p>Inspectors generate PDF findings report citing specific <b>NYC Housing Code violations</b> (e.g., 27-2008 heat, 27-2017 pests) with violation class and correction deadlines. This report details the <b>HPD investigation</b> results after the site visit. Tenants receive it via mail or can check it online.</p> <p>The report includes key sections like property info, violation list with code numbers, descriptions, and photos, correction dates, and inspector signature. Each <b>code violation</b> gets classified as A, B, or C based on severity. Class A violations, like heat issues, have shorter <b>repair timelines</b>.</p> <p>Common violations include <b>27-2008</b> for failing to maintain 68 degreesF from 6am to 12am during heating season, 27-2017 for pest infestations requiring extermination, 27-2005 for inadequate hot water supply, 27-2017.1 for lead paint hazards in older buildings, and <b>27-2007</b> for malfunctioning window guards. Landlords must address these with proof of correction. Tenants can use photos from the report for follow-up status checks.</p> <p>For structural issues, HPD cross-references with the <b>DOB violation</b> process by notifying the Department of Buildings during inspection. If a building shows signs of unsafe conditions like cracks or illegal conversions, the inspector flags it. This leads to joint enforcement, ensuring comprehensive <b>complaint resolution</b>.</p> <h2>Initial Acknowledgment</h2> <p>After filing your HPD complaint via 311 or the myHPD portal, expect confirmation within 24-48 hours. HPD sends a <b>digital or email confirmation</b> with your case number. This starts the HPD process for your housing complaint.</p> <p>The acknowledgment confirms receipt of your report on issues like <i>heat complaints</i> or <b>pest infestations</b>. It provides a unique identifier for tracking. Use this to check status in the myHPD portal.</p> <p>Save the confirmation email or note the case number right away. It helps with follow-up status checks and escalations if needed. Tenants often use it to discuss with building superintendents or property owners.</p> <p>This step ensures your <b>tenant rights</b> are protected from the start. It sets expectations for the inspection process and repair timeline. Contact HPD if you do not receive it within the timeframe.</p> <h3>What the Confirmation Includes</h3> <p>Your confirmation details the <b>case number format</b>, such as HP D#######. This number tracks your HPD complaint through the entire process. It appears immediately for most 311 service calls.</p> <p>Expect <b>estimated response times</b> based on violation class per NYC Housing Code. <b>Class A violations</b>, like no heat or hot water issues, target 14 days. Class B violations, such as pest infestations, aim for 30 days.</p> <p><b>Class C violations</b>, including lead paint hazards or mold remediation, have up to 120 days. These timelines guide the HPD investigation and landlord response. They help set realistic expectations for complaint resolution.</p> <ul><li><b>Case number</b>: Unique ID like HP D1234567 for all updates.</li> <li><b>Response times</b>: Class-specific deadlines from NYC Housing Code.</li> <li><b>Access instructions</b>: Steps to log into myHPD portal for real-time tracking.</li> <li><b>Contact info</b>: HPD field office or borough office details for questions.</li></ul> <p>Log into the <b>online portal</b> using these instructions to monitor progress. Submit photos or witness statements there for complaint verification. This keeps you informed on site visits or inspector reports.</p> <h2>Complaint Review and Assignment</h2><img alt="Complaint Review and Assignment" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/what-happens-after-i-file-a-complaint-with-hpd(oej3)_2.jpeg"/> <p>HPD triage team reviews complaints within <b>3 business days</b>, prioritizing Class A (immediately hazardous) violations like no heat over Class C (less severe) per NYC Admin Code 27-2005. This initial step classifies your HPD complaint by violation severity using a <b>3-tier system</b>. Within 72 hours, the team assigns it to the appropriate borough office for further action.</p> <p>Classification ensures <b>emergency repair</b> needs get fast attention, such as a <i>boiler breakdown</i> or gas leak. Less urgent issues like <i>window repair</i> fall into lower tiers. You receive a case number via email or the online portal for tracking.</p> <p>HPD's 5 borough offices handle the workload, sending an HPD inspector based on location and priority. Tenants should check complaint status regularly through the myHPD portal or 311 service. This process sets the stage for the inspection process and landlord response.</p> <p>If your housing complaint involves <i>heat complaint</i> or <i>pest infestation</i>, expect quicker assignment. Document everything with photos for complaint verification. Understanding this triage helps manage expectations after filing.</p> <h3>Classification Criteria</h3> <p>HPD uses a 3-tier system to sort <b>code violations</b>: Class A for immediate danger, Class B for hazards needing prompt fixes, and Class C for lesser issues. For example, a <i>lead paint hazard</i> or <i>structural issue</i> lands in Class A, triggering swift response. This aligns with NYC housing code to protect tenant rights.</p> <p>Class B covers problems like <i>mold remediation</i> or <i>hot water issue</i>, requiring action within set timelines. Class C includes door lock repairs or minor bathroom fixture issues. Accurate classification depends on your description during <b>complaint filing</b>.</p> <p>Provide detailed info, like <i>rodent control</i> extent, to aid triage. Anonymous complaints get reviewed too, but specifics speed up HPD response time. Misclassification can delay <b>violation notice</b> issuance.</p> <p>Experts recommend submitting <b>documented evidence</b> such as photos with your service request. This helps verify <b>habitability violation</b> claims early. Track via online portal to confirm your tier.</p> <h3>Inspector Assignment Process</h3> <p>After classification, HPD assigns an HPD inspector from the relevant <b>HPD borough office</b>, like Manhattan or Brooklyn add 1.1M complaints annually. Assignment considers <b>priority violation</b> level and location for efficient HPD investigation. You get a complaint acknowledgment with the inspector's contact.</p> <p>Inspectors schedule a site visit based on urgency, often within days for Class A like <i>electrical hazard</i>. For non-emergency complaints, waits may extend. The investigation timeline starts here, leading to an <b>inspector report</b>.</p> <p>Contact your building superintendent or managing agent if needed before the visit. Prepare by noting <i>unsafe conditions</i> for the inspector. This step ensures proper documentation of <b>building violation</b>.</p> <p>Follow-up on follow-up status if no assignment notice arrives. Use the <b>HPD hotline</b> or portal for updates. Assignment marks the shift to active complaint resolution.</p> <h2>Site Inspection</h2> <p>Inspectors schedule Class A visits within 14 days using HPD's Field Management System, coordinating with supers/tenants via phone/text. After you file a complaint with HPD, an HPD inspector contacts you to arrange this key step in the HPD investigation. The site visit typically lasts 30-60 minutes.</p> <p>Expect a call or text from the HPD field office tied to your case number. They confirm details from your housing complaint, such as a <i>heat complaint</i> or <i>pest infestation</i>. Provide access details for the building superintendent or managing agent.</p> <p>During the inspection process, the inspector checks for code violations like <i>hot water issues</i> or <i>mold remediation</i> needs. They document findings with photos and notes for the inspector report. This leads to a violation notice if issues are verified.</p> <p>Track progress via the myHPD portal or 311 service for complaint status. Tenants should prepare evidence like <i>photo submissions</i> to support complaint verification. Follow-up ensures repair timeline adherence.</p> <h3>Preparation Checklist</h3> <p>Before the HPD inspector arrives, review this preparation checklist to make code violations easy to spot. Clear access to affected areas, such as the kitchen for a <i>boiler breakdown</i> or bathroom for <i>window repair</i> issues. Gather any documented evidence like prior witness statements.</p> <p>Notify your tenant association or neighbors if the site visit impacts shared spaces. Ensure lights work in dim areas for electrical hazard checks. Have your case number ready for quick reference.</p> <ul><li>Clean paths to <b>priority violations</b> like <i>rodent control</i> areas.</li> <li>Collect rent receipts showing <b>habitability violations</b>.</li> <li>Note dates of <b>unsafe conditions</b>, such as a <i>gas leak</i>.</li> <li>Prepare a list of ongoing issues for the inspector report.</li></ul> <p>This prep strengthens your HPD complaint and speeds complaint resolution. Experts recommend labeling problems with notes for the inspector.</p> <h3>What Happens During the Visit</h3> <p>The HPD inspector arrives on schedule for the <b>site inspection</b>, starting with tenant or super interview. They examine reported issues, like a <i>structural issue</i> or <i>door lock</i> failure, using a checklist from the <b>NYC housing code</b>. Measurements and photos capture evidence.</p> <p>For <b>Class A B C violations</b>, they classify severity, noting <b>immediate danger</b> for emergencies. Tenants can point out hidden problems, such as <i>lead paint hazards</i> behind furniture. The visit ends with a verbal summary of findings.</p> <p>Inspectors issue an order to correct on-site if violations are clear, setting a <b>repair timeline</b>. They may coordinate with DOB violation teams for related issues. You receive a copy of observations via the online portal.</p> <p>Post-visit, expect HPD response time updates on violation notice issuance. This step verifies your non-emergency complaint and launches enforcement against the <b>property owner</b>.</p> <h2>Violation Documentation</h2> <p>Inspectors document using <b>HP DS handheld devices</b> uploading to BIS system in real-time, photographing most violations per <b>HPD inspection protocols</b>. This happens during the typical inspection after you file a complaint with HPD. Accurate records ensure code violations are tracked properly.</p> <p>The inspection process captures details like measurements and conditions on site. For a <i>heat complaint</i> or <i>pest infestation</i>, inspectors note temperatures or evidence of rodents. This documented evidence supports enforcement actions against the landlord.</p> <p>Tenants benefit from this thorough approach as it creates a clear record for follow-up status. You can request copies through the myHPD portal using your case number. Keep your own photos as backup for any disputes.</p> <p><b>HPD investigators</b> classify findings into Class A, B, or C violations based on severity. Priority goes to immediate danger like gas leaks or structural issues. This documentation drives the next steps in complaint resolution.</p> <h3>Inspector Report Contents</h3><img alt="Inspector Report Contents" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/what-happens-after-i-file-a-complaint-with-hpd(oej3)_3.jpeg"/> <p>The inspector report lists all observed code violations with specifics. It includes photos, measurements, and notes on issues like <i>mold remediation</i> needs or broken window repairs. This forms the basis for any violation notice.</p> <p>Reports detail NYC housing code breaches, such as hot water issues or illegal conversions. Inspectors note if conditions affect <b>habitability</b>, like overcrowding or unsafe electrical hazards. Owners receive this to prompt violation correction.</p> <p>Classifications help prioritize: Class C for immediate threats like boiler breakdowns. Class B covers hazards needing quick fixes, such as door locks. Class A involves less urgent items like cosmetic repairs.</p> <p>You can access report summaries via online portal or HPD hotline. Use it to monitor repair timeline and prepare for <b>reinspection</b>. Strong documentation strengthens your tenant rights.</p> <h3>Tenant Copy Process</h3> <p>After the site visit, HPD provides tenants with a copy of the findings. Request it at the HPD field office or through your <b>311 service</b> confirmation. This helps you track landlord response.</p> <p>The process involves emailing or mailing the report linked to your case number. For anonymous complaints, use the myHPD portal for secure access. It includes <b>order to correct</b> details for the owner.</p> <p>Keep this document for complaint verification or escalation. If no progress, it supports <b>hearing request</b> or housing court action. Tenants often pair it with their own photo submission.</p> <p>Delays in receiving copies? Follow up via HPD borough office. This ensures transparency in the HPD process after filing. It give the power tos you during <b>compliance monitoring</b>.</p> <h2>Notice of Violation (NOV)</h2> <p>After an HPD investigation confirms issues from your complaint filing, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development mails the <b>Notice of Violation (NOV)</b> to the owner or managing agent within 10 days. Tenants receive a digital copy via the myHPD portal. This document cites exact violations under NYC Admin Code 27-2115, with fines ranging from $250 to $2,000 per violation.</p> <p>The NOV includes a unique <b>header like HPD#######-NOV</b>, followed by owner information and up to 15 specific violation descriptions. Each description details the code violation, such as a <i>"leaky ceiling in apartment 3B due to failed roof membrane"</i> or <i>"rodent infestation in basement"</i>. Correction deadlines depend on violation class: Class A within 24 hours, Class B within 14 days, and Class C within 30 days.</p> <p>Owners face a <b>fine schedule</b> based on violation class and severity, escalating for repeat issues or willful violations. The notice outlines <b>appeal instructions</b>, allowing owners to request an administrative hearing within 30 days. Tenants can track open violations and repair timelines through the online portal using the case number.</p> <p>HPD serves the NOV via <b>certified mail</b> and by posting it on the premises, often in the lobby or superintendent's office. Sample language reads, <i>"Pursuant to Section 27-2115 of the NYC Administrative Code, you are hereby notified that the above described violation(s) was/were observed during an inspection."</i> This ensures property owners address habitability violations like heat complaints or pest infestations promptly.</p> <h2>Corrective Action Period</h2> <p>Owners have Class A violations with 24 hours, Class B violations with 14 days, and Class C violations with 30 days to correct per the Notice of Violation after you file a complaint with HPD. This repair timeline starts from the date the owner receives the NOV. Tenants play a key role in monitoring progress during this window.</p> <p>The <b>corrective action period</b> ensures prompt fixes for issues like heat complaints or pest infestations. Owners must submit proof of correction, such as photos and contractor invoices, through the myHPD portal. Tenants should track daily with their own photos to document any delays.</p> <p>Extensions are possible for <b>emergency repairs</b>, like weather-related delays up to 7 days with HPD approval. If no progress occurs, tenants can request reinspection via the online portal using their case number. This keeps pressure on the property owner for compliance.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Violation Class</th><th>Correction Period</th><th>Extension Rules</th><th>Tenant Actions During Period</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><b>Class A</b> (immediate danger, e.g., gas leak)</td><td>24 hours</td><td>No extensions; emergency only</td><td>Daily photos, notify HPD if unmet</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Class B</b> (hazardous, e.g., boiler breakdown)</td><td>14 days</td><td>Up to 7 days for weather/emergency with proof</td><td>Monitor site, submit evidence via portal</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Class C</b> (less severe, e.g., window repair)</td><td>30 days</td><td>Case-by-case approval required</td><td>Document conditions, request status update</td></tr></tbody></table> <h3>Submitting Proof of Correction</h3> <p>Owners submit <b>proof of correction</b> to HPD, including dated photos of completed work and contractor invoices. Use the myHPD portal or visit an HPD field office with your case number. This verifies fixes for violations like mold remediation or rodent control.</p> <p>For example, after a hot water issue repair, include before-and-after photos of the bathroom fixture. HPD reviews submissions within a few business days. If incomplete, the open violation remains active.</p> <p>Tenants can check complaint status online to confirm closure. Keep your own records as documented evidence. This supports follow-up if the owner claims correction without real changes.</p> <h3>Tenant Monitoring Checklist</h3> <p>During the <b>correction period</b>, tenants should follow a daily monitoring checklist. Take timestamped photos of the violation site, like a structural issue or door lock. Note any building superintendent activity or lack thereof.</p> <p><ul><li>Capture clear, well-lit images from multiple angles.</li> <li>Record dates, times, and weather conditions.</li> <li>Log interactions with the managing agent.</li> <li>Upload to HPD via service request if no progress.</li></ul></p> <p>This tenant rights practice builds a strong record for reinspection requests. Share photos with a tenant association if applicable. It helps escalate to an administrative hearing if needed.</p> <h3>Emergency Extensions and Escalation</h3> <p>HPD grants <b>emergency extensions</b> up to 7 days for weather-related delays, like during a storm affecting electrical hazards. Owners must provide justification promptly. Tenants can object through the HPD hotline or 311 service.</p> <p>If the repair timeline lapses without fixes, request reinspection online. Persistent issues may lead to civil penalties or alternative enforcement program involvement. Document everything to protect against tenant harassment.</p> <p>For habitability violations like lead paint hazards, escalate via housing court if HPD delays. Legal aid organizations offer support for eviction protection. Always reference your violation notice for leverage.</p> <h2>Compliance Inspection</h2><img alt="Compliance Inspection" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/what-happens-after-i-file-a-complaint-with-hpd(oej3)_4.jpeg"/> <p>HPD schedules reinspection within 5 days of owner correction claim. Most corrected violations receive Compliance Certificates uploaded to BIS within 48 hours. This step verifies if the <b>landlord response</b> to the violation notice meets NYC housing code standards.</p> <p>Property owners start the <b>reinspection process</b> by requesting it through HPDBIS.nyc.gov. They must pay a $143 fee to schedule the visit. An HPD inspector then checks repairs for issues like <i>heat complaints</i> or <i>pest infestations</i>.</p> <p>If fixes pass, the inspector issues a Compliance Cert #HPD-CERT-######. Tenants have the right to attend this reinspection and confirm resolution of their housing complaint. Keep track via the myHPD portal for complaint status updates.</p> <p>Failure means <b>doubled fines</b> and open violations remain active. Owners face <b>civil penalties</b> or escalation to alternative enforcement program. Tenants can request follow-up status if problems persist after filing.</p> <h2>Enforcement Actions</h2> <p>Non-compliant owners face <b>$500 daily fines</b>, AEP placement (emergency repairs at owner expense), or Housing Court summons. HPD collected $42M fines in 2023. These steps form an <b>escalation ladder</b> to push landlords into fixing <i>heat complaints</i>, <i>pest infestations</i>, or other code violations.</p> <p>The process starts with a Notice of Violation (NOV) as Level 1 enforcement. If ignored, it moves to <b>Willful Violation Notice</b> with fines over $2,000. Tenants can track progress via the myHPD portal using their case number.</p> <p>Further up, the <b>AEP program</b> covers 7,200 buildings with average $15K repairs. HPD handles boiler breakdowns or <i>mold remediation</i>, then liens the property for three times the cost. This protects tenants from unsafe conditions like <i>electrical hazards</i>.</p> <p>Top levels include <b>ECB hearings</b> for civil penalties and Criminal Court for severe cases. Tenants have options like <b>7A receivership</b> to appoint a court overseer or track ECB payments. Always submit <i>photo evidence</i> during follow-up for stronger enforcement.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>What Happens After I File a Complaint with HPD?</h3> <p>After you file a complaint with the Honolulu Police Department (HPD), they will assign a case number and an officer to investigate.
