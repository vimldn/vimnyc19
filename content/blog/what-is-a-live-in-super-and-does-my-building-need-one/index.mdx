<p>Picture this: Your toilet overflows at 2 a.m., and help arrives in minutes-because the super lives downstairs. <b>Live-in supers</b> are building heroes, but are they right for yours?</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Want to sanity-check a specific address? <a href="/">Search it on Building Health X</a> to see recent heat/hot water, pests, noise, safety and violations across 30/90 days, 1 year and 3 years.</p> <p>In NYC and beyond, these on-site pros handle everything from leaks to lockouts. We'll break down their duties, <i>legal must-haves</i>, pros/cons, costs, and when your building truly needs one-plus smart alternatives. Stick around to decide!</p><h2>What Is a Live-In Super?</h2><img alt="What Is a Live-In Super?" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/what-is-a-livein-super-and-does-my-building-need-one(d3h3)_1.jpeg"/> <p>A live-in super is an on-site building manager who lives rent-free in the property and handles everything from <i>plumbing repairs</i> to tenant lockouts 24/7. This role combines duties of a handyman, janitor, <b>porter</b>, and resident manager. The superintendent occupies a <b>subsidized super apartment</b> with free rent, utilities covered, and a monthly stipend of several hundred dollars.</p> <p>Live-in supers prove essential for multi-family buildings with six or more units, especially in areas with strict <b>NYC housing laws</b>. They ensure 24-hour maintenance for apartment units in high-rise, low-rise, co-op, or condo buildings. Property owners rely on them to meet building codes and <b>local regulations</b> for mandatory supers.</p> <p>Unlike a doorman, who focuses on guests and package delivery, or a part-time handyman without 24/7 availability, the live-in superintendent provides constant oversight. They manage tenant complaints, coordinate vendors, and handle emergency repairs. This setup supports <b>landlord obligations</b> and protects <b>tenant rights</b> in rental properties.</p> <p>For smaller buildings, owners weigh <b>building requirements</b> based on unit count. A <b>required superintendent</b> keeps the residential building compliant with safety standards. Hiring one involves checking super qualifications like experience and certifications.</p> <h3>Core Responsibilities</h3> <p>Core duties include 24/7 emergency response, routine maintenance, and tenant coordination for the <b>live-in superintendent</b>. These <b>super responsibilities</b> cover a wide range in multi-family buildings. Owners depend on them for smooth property management.</p> <p>Key tasks feature these eight areas:</p> <ul><li><b>Emergency repairs</b>: Fix burst pipes or flooding within hours.</li> <li><b>HVAC and boiler monitoring</b>: Perform daily checks in the <b>boiler room</b>.</li> <li><b>Unit turnover</b>: Handle painting and cleaning between tenants for <b>vacancy preparation</b>.</li> <li><b>Common area maintenance</b>: Clean lobbies, elevators, and hallways.</li> <li><b>Trash and snow removal</b>: Manage daily waste and winter clearing.</li> <li><b>Vendor coordination</b>: Oversee contractors for <b>pest control</b> or roof repairs.</li> <li><b>Logbook documentation</b>: Record all <b>maintenance records</b> and incidents.</li> <li><b>Fire and safety inspections</b>: Check systems for <b>code compliance</b>.</li></ul> <p>A simple daily checklist helps supers stay organized: boiler temp, trash bins, lobby sweep, elevator function, and pending work review. This template ensures preventive maintenance and <b>building inspection</b> readiness. It supports <b>fire safety</b> and security measures like intercom systems.</p> <h3>Daily vs. On-Call Duties</h3> <p>Daily duties take 6-8 hours from 9am to 5pm, while <b>on-call duties</b> handle emergencies during nights and weekends for the <b>building superintendent</b>. This split defines the work schedule in residential buildings. It balances routine super duties with urgent needs.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Duty Type</th><th>Examples</th><th>Frequency</th><th>Time Required</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><b>Daily</b></td><td>Boiler checks, trash collection, lobby maintenance</td><td>Weekdays</td><td>6-8 hours, scheduled</td></tr> <tr><td><b>On-Call</b></td><td>Flooding, lockouts, heat complaints, electrical repairs</td><td>Nights, weekends</td><td>2-3 calls per shift, emergency</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>A typical workweek includes 40 hours of regular tasks plus 15 hours on-call, covering <b>heating system</b> issues or key access. Labor laws require overtime pay for hours beyond 40. Supers track time in the <b>logbook</b> to comply with regulations.</p> <p>Property managers adjust for <b>building size</b>, with larger high-rise buildings needing more support. Alternatives like outsourcing to a management company exist for small buildings. This structure ensures <b>24/7 availability</b> without burnout.</p> <h2>Live-In Super vs. Part-Time Maintenance</h2> <p>Live-in supers provide <b>24/7 coverage</b> while part-timers cost 60% less but leave buildings vulnerable after 5pm. A live-in superintendent lives on-site in a <i>super apartment</i>, handling emergencies like plumbing repairs or lockouts at any hour. Part-time maintenance workers, however, follow strict schedules and often require outsourcing for nights and weekends.</p> <p>Choosing between these options depends on your <b>apartment building</b>'s size and needs. For a multi-family building with over 10 units, a live-in super ensures quick response to tenant complaints and <b>emergency repairs</b>. Part-timers suit smaller properties where issues arise mainly during business hours.</p> <table><thead><tr><th><b>Aspect</b></th><th><b>Live-In Super</b></th><th><b>Part-Time Maintenance</b></th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><b>Cost</b></td><td>Free rent + salary compensation</td><td>Hourly rate for limited hours</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Response Time</b></td><td>Immediate, 24/7 availability</td><td>Scheduled hours only</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Coverage</b></td><td>Full building, on-site maintenance</td><td>Limited scope and areas</td></tr> <tr><td><b>Tenant Satisfaction</b></td><td>High due to constant presence</td><td>Lower for off-hour needs</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Consider a <b>hybrid model</b> for balance, such as a live-in super for daily super duties like trash removal and lobby maintenance, paired with part-time help for specialized tasks like HVAC maintenance. This approach cuts costs while maintaining 24-hour maintenance. Property owners in rent-stabilized buildings often find hybrids meet NYC housing laws on building staffing.</p> <h3>Key Responsibilities and Availability</h3> <p>Live-in supers manage a wide range of super responsibilities, from boiler room checks to snow removal. Their on-call duties cover nights, ensuring <b>elevators</b> and common areas stay functional. Part-timers focus on daytime tasks like painting during unit turnover.</p> <p>24/7 availability sets live-in caretakers apart, addressing lockouts or electrical repairs promptly. In high-rise buildings, this prevents small issues from escalating. Part-time staff handle routine <b>preventive maintenance</b> but leave gaps in coverage.</p> <p>For co-op buildings, boards prioritize supers who track maintenance records in a logbook. This includes pest control and vendor coordination. Part-timers may log hours but lack the full oversight of a resident manager.</p> <h3>Cost and Budget Considerations</h3> <p>Live-in supers receive <b>free rent</b> and utility coverage plus salary, making them cost-effective for large buildings. Part-time hires involve hourly pay without housing perks, suiting low-rise properties. Weigh these against risks like delayed heating system fixes.</p> <p>Landlord obligations under local regulations may require a mandatory super for buildings over certain unit counts. Budget for overtime pay in employment agreements to cover peak seasons. Management companies often recommend hybrids to optimize expenses.</p> <p>In market-rate buildings, the investment in a live-in superintendent boosts tenant retention through reliable key access and package delivery. Small buildings might outsource to handymen, avoiding full-time commitments. Always review super contracts for performance reviews and termination clauses.</p> <h3>Legal Requirements and Building Size</h3> <p><b>Building codes</b> in areas like NYC dictate when a required superintendent is needed, often based on the number of apartment units. High-rise or multi-family buildings typically mandate on-site presence for fire safety and code compliance. Smaller rental properties have flexibility with part-timers.</p> <p>Co-op boards and housing authorities enforce staffing rules to protect tenant rights. Live-in supers ensure security measures like intercom systems function around the clock. Verify certification requirements and background checks when hiring.</p> <p>For condo buildings, owners balance super qualifications with work schedules under labor laws. A live-in option supports full coverage without constant overtime. Consult building policies and resident handbooks for super contact info and emergency protocols.</p> <h2>Legal Requirements by Location</h2><img alt="Legal Requirements by Location" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/what-is-a-livein-super-and-does-my-building-need-one(d3h3)_2.jpeg"/> <p>Local <b>housing codes</b> mandate <b>live-in supers</b> based on unit count and building type. NYC's Multiple Dwelling Law stands out as the strictest. Always check your municipal housing authority for specifics.</p> <p>Buildings with <b>6+ units in NYC</b> legally require 24/7 supers. Other cities vary, such as 4 units in Chicago or none in Miami. Non-compliance risks steep fines and lawsuits from tenants or authorities.</p> <p>Owners of <b>multi-family buildings</b> must review local regulations to avoid penalties. For example, a rental property in a regulated area might need a <b>resident manager</b> for on-site maintenance like emergency repairs or boiler checks. Consulting the housing authority ensures code compliance.</p> <p>Landlords often weigh building size against requirements. Small buildings may skip a live-in superintendent, but larger ones face mandatory staffing for tenant rights and safety standards.</p> <h3>New York City Rules</h3> <p>NYC Multiple Dwelling Law 27 requires buildings with <b>6+ units</b> to have live-in supers with max 5min walk to boiler. This covers <b>NYC Admin Code 27-809</b>. The super apartment must be on-site for 24/7 coverage.</p> <p>A <b>station house rule</b> allows the superintendent within 200ft, but live-in remains standard. Violations trigger $500 daily fines from HPD. Rent-stabilized buildings face extra scrutiny for super duties like lockouts and trash removal.</p> <p>Practical examples include high-rise buildings needing 24-hour maintenance for elevators and heating systems. Property owners must provide free rent or salary compensation in the super apartment. Hiring requires background checks and experience in plumbing repairs or HVAC maintenance.</p> <p>Co-op boards and condo buildings enforce these via <b>super contracts</b>. Regular building inspections confirm compliance, protecting against lawsuits over issues like pest control or fire safety.</p> <h3>Other Major Cities</h3> <p>Chicago mandates supers for <b>4+ units</b> while LA and San Francisco have no requirements but fines for maintenance violations. Rules differ widely by jurisdiction. Always verify with local housing authorities for updates.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>City</th><th>Min Units</th><th>Live-In Required?</th><th>Citation</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Chicago</td><td>4</td><td>Yes</td><td>MCC 13-196-610</td></tr> <tr><td>Los Angeles</td><td>None</td><td>No</td><td>LAMC 91.8101</td></tr> <tr><td>Boston</td><td>5</td><td>Yes</td><td>105 CMR 410</td></tr> <tr><td>San Francisco</td><td>None</td><td>No</td><td>SFC Housing Code</td></tr> <tr><td>Miami</td><td>None</td><td>No</td><td>Miami-Dade Code</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>In Chicago, <b>apartment buildings</b> need on-call duties for snow removal and common areas. Boston requires coverage for low-rise buildings with emergency repairs. Cities without mandates often outsource to management companies for cost savings.</p> <p>Owners of <b>rental properties</b> in unregulated areas might hire part-time handymen instead. However, tenant complaints about roof repairs or electrical issues push many toward resident managers. Check 2024 updates from state housing authorities for changes.</p> <h2>Pros of Having a Live-In Super</h2> <p>Buildings with live-in supers see benefits like fewer maintenance complaints and better tenant retention. Research suggests these on-site staff members handle issues quickly. This leads to smoother <b>property management</b> in apartment buildings.</p> <p>A live-in superintendent provides <b>24-hour maintenance</b> availability. Tenants get help with lockouts or leaks at any time. This immediate response prevents small problems from growing into major repairs.</p> <p>Key advantages include rapid emergency handling and cost savings on vendors. Satisfied residents stay longer, reducing turnover. Property owners enjoy higher stability in multi-family buildings.</p> <ul><li><b>24/7 response</b> cuts emergency costs through quick fixes, avoiding expensive after-hours calls.</li> <li>High <b>tenant satisfaction</b> from reliable on-site support for daily needs.</li> <li>Increased <b>property values</b> due to well-maintained common areas and elevators.</li> <li>Lower <b>vacancy turnover</b> as happy tenants renew leases more often.</li> <li>Savings on <b>vendor costs</b> by handling routine tasks like plumbing repairs in-house.</li> <li><b>Immediate issue resolution</b> stops minor complaints, such as heating system glitches, from escalating.</li></ul> <p>To calculate <b>ROI</b>, compare the super's salary and free apartment costs against savings. For example, in a 50-unit rental property, reduced vendor fees and lower vacancies might offset expenses within a year. Track maintenance records to measure real gains.</p> <h2>Cons and Potential Drawbacks</h2> <p>Live-in supers create <b>privacy concerns</b> and potential liability if unqualified repairs cause damage. Tenants often feel uneasy with a live-in superintendent having constant access to the residential building. Property owners must weigh these issues against the benefits of 24-hour maintenance.</p> <p>Common problems include <b>invasion of privacy</b>, poor work quality, and abuse of the super apartment. Additional drawbacks involve family drama leading to tenant conflicts and high turnover among live-in caretakers. Addressing these requires clear policies and careful hiring for the apartment building.</p> <p>Experts recommend establishing <b>boundaries in the resident handbook</b> to protect tenant rights. Regular performance reviews help maintain building maintenance standards. A Brooklyn co-op lawsuit highlighted risks when a live-in super's negligence led to flooding from botched plumbing repairs.</p> <p>In that case, the co-op board faced costly legal battles over landlord obligations and code compliance. The court ruled in favor of tenants, emphasizing the need for certified supers in multi-family buildings. Property management teams can avoid such pitfalls with proactive measures.</p> <h3>Privacy Invasion</h3> <p><b>Privacy invasion</b> tops complaints about live-in supers in multi-family buildings. The superintendent's 24/7 availability means they might enter units for lockouts or emergency repairs without notice. This setup blurs lines between super duties and tenant personal space.</p> <p>Solution: Implement a <b>clear boundaries policy</b> in the employment agreement. Require supers to use the intercom system or buzzer for access and log all entries in maintenance records. Tenants gain peace of mind with defined rules on key access and unit turnover visits.</p> <p>For example, designate specific hours for non-emergency tasks like vacancy preparation. Include super contact info in the resident handbook to set expectations for on-call duties. This approach respects tenant rights while ensuring building requirements for safety standards.</p> <h3>Poor Work Quality</h3> <p>Unqualified live-in supers risk <b>poor work quality</b> in tasks like electrical repairs or HVAC maintenance. Inexperienced handymen may overlook building codes, leading to safety hazards in common areas or the boiler room. Property owners face liability for subpar on-site maintenance.</p> <p>Solution: Conduct thorough <b>background checks</b> and verify certifications before hiring. Require experience in plumbing repairs, roof repairs, and pest control to meet local regulations. Regular building inspections ensure compliance with NYC housing laws.</p> <p>Train supers on preventive maintenance and tool inventory management. Performance reviews tied to super responsibilities catch issues early. This minimizes risks in high-rise buildings or rent-stabilized properties where standards are strict.</p> <h3>Abuse of Super Apartment</h3><img alt="Abuse of Super Apartment" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/what-is-a-livein-super-and-does-my-building-need-one(d3h3)_3.jpeg"/> <p>Live-in supers sometimes <b>abuse the super apartment</b>, treating subsidized housing as personal space beyond free rent and utility coverage. They might host unauthorized guests or neglect building manager duties. This strains relations in co-op buildings or condo buildings.</p> <p>Solution: Include <b>performance clauses</b> in the super contract. Specify that the apartment is conditional on fulfilling 24/7 availability and work schedule. Termination clauses allow quick action for violations of labor laws or overtime pay disputes.</p> <p>Monitor usage through board of directors oversight. Tie salary compensation to logbook entries for trash removal or snow removal. Clear terms prevent misuse while supporting essential services like elevator maintenance.</p> <h3>Family Drama and Tenant Conflicts</h3> <p><b>Family drama</b> arises when a live-in super's relatives live in the super apartment, sparking tenant complaints. Conflicts over noise or access control disrupt lobby maintenance and package delivery. This common issue affects harmony in rental properties.</p> <p>Address it by limiting family occupancy in the employment agreement. Prohibit non-employee relatives from using amenities like the laundry room. Mediate disputes promptly to uphold tenant rights and building policy.</p> <p>Vendor coordination and mail handling stay neutral when supers follow guidelines. Resident managers focused on super responsibilities avoid favoritism. Strong rules foster a stable environment for all in the residential building.</p> <h3>High Turnover</h3> <p>High turnover plagues live-in superintendent roles due to demanding on-call duties and isolation. Supers often leave small buildings or large buildings seeking better work-life balance. Replacing them disrupts property management and emergency repairs.</p> <p>Solution: Offer competitive salary compensation and clear super qualifications in job postings. Build loyalty with fair overtime pay and performance reviews. Long-term contracts reduce gaps in building staffing.</p> <p>Consider alternatives like outsourcing maintenance or a management company for low-rise buildings. Retain staff by providing certification requirements support and tool inventory. Stable supers ensure consistent cleaning services and code compliance.</p> <h2>Does Your Building Need One?</h2> <p>Buildings under 6 units rarely need live-in supers; 20+ units make them essential for tenant retention. Assess your apartment building based on the number of units, tenant complaints, maintenance costs, and local laws. Small buildings often manage with part-timers, while larger ones require 24/7 coverage for on-site maintenance.</p> <p>For a multi-family building, consider frequent issues like plumbing repairs or lockouts. If tenants report delays in emergency repairs, a resident manager can address them quickly. Local regulations, such as NYC housing laws, may mandate a required superintendent for certain sizes.</p> <p>Review your property management setup and budget considerations. High maintenance costs from outsourcing signal the need for a <b>live-in caretaker</b>. Use the decision matrix in the next section to evaluate your building's requirements.</p> <p>Experts recommend checking <b>building codes</b> and tenant rights first. For rental properties or co-op buildings, a super handles super duties like trash removal and vacancy preparation. This ensures code compliance and resident satisfaction.</p> <h3>Building Size Factors</h3> <p>6-10 units: Optional but recommended; 20+ units: Essential for operations. Building size directly impacts the need for a building superintendent. Smaller properties rely on handymen, while larger ones demand full-time presence for 24-hour maintenance.</p> <p>Use this decision matrix to assess your <b>residential building</b>.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Units</th> <th>Need Level</th> <th>Annual Cost</th> <th>Alternatives</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>1-5</td> <td>None</td> <td>$0</td> <td>Handyman contracts</td></tr> <tr><td>6-15</td> <td>Required (NYC)</td> <td>$18K</td> <td>Part-time + on-call</td></tr> <tr><td>16-50</td> <td>Essential</td> <td>$24K</td> <td>Full-time live-in</td></tr> <tr><td>50+</td> <td>Multiple supers</td> <td>$48K+</td> <td>Management company</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Larger buildings face more maintenance calls per unit, like <i>elevator repairs</i> or <b>HVAC maintenance</b>. A live-in superintendent manages these efficiently, reducing downtime. For high-rise buildings, multiple staff ensure coverage.</p> <p>Small low-rise buildings save with <b>outsourcing maintenance</b>, such as vendor coordination for pest control. Track your logbook for patterns in tenant complaints or unit turnover. This data guides hiring decisions for your <b>property owner</b> or co-op board.</p> <h2>Costs and Compensation</h2> <p>The average cost for a <b>live-in super</b> includes a free 1-bedroom apartment with a $2,800 monthly value plus $1,200 in monthly salary, totaling around $48,000 annually. This package covers <b>on-site maintenance</b> and 24-hour availability in a residential building. Property owners often view it as more cost-effective than hiring part-time staff.</p> <p>In <b>New York City</b>, compensation breaks down into key components like apartment value, base salary, and utilities. Owners typically provide the <b>super apartment</b> rent-free, along with utility coverage, to offset the live-in commitment. Salary supplements this, with potential overtime for emergency repairs or heavy workloads.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>NYC Avg</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Apartment</td><td>$33,600/yr</td><td>1BR market rate</td></tr> <tr><td>Salary</td><td>$18,000/yr</td><td>+overtime</td></tr> <tr><td>Utilities</td><td>$2,400/yr</td><td>Owner pays</td></tr> <tr><td>Total</td><td>$54K/yr</td><td>Vs $72K part-time</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Regional variations affect these figures. In high-cost areas like NYC, apartment values drive up totals, while smaller markets offer lower salaries but similar free rent perks. Negotiate based on building size and super duties, such as handling plumbing repairs or snow removal.</p> <p>For a <b>multi-family building</b>, compare live-in costs to outsourcing. A live-in superintendent saves on travel time for issues like lockouts or HVAC maintenance. Always include overtime pay in the employment agreement to comply with labor laws.</p> <h3>Regional Variations</h3> <p>Costs for a building superintendent shift by location due to housing markets and local regulations. In NYC, high apartment values make the total package pricier than in suburban areas. Smaller towns might offer a free unit worth less but pair it with competitive salary compensation.</p> <p>Consider <b>high-rise buildings</b> in urban centers, where 24/7 availability commands premium utilities and pay. Low-rise or co-op buildings in quieter regions often see lower averages. Tailor offers to the number of apartment units and expected super responsibilities like elevator maintenance.</p> <p>Experts recommend reviewing comparable properties nearby. For rent-stabilized buildings, NYC housing laws may influence what landlords must provide. Adjust for factors like pest control demands or winter snow removal frequency.</p> <h3>Negotiation Tips</h3><img alt="Negotiation Tips" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/what-is-a-livein-super-and-does-my-building-need-one(d3h3)_4.jpeg"/> <p>Start negotiations by clarifying <b>super duties</b> in the employment agreement, such as trash removal or tenant complaints. Propose a base salary with clear overtime terms for on-call duties. Highlight the value of free rent and utilities as core incentives.</p> <p>Leverage building needs to your advantage. For a rental property with frequent unit turnovers, request tool inventory or certification reimbursements. Include performance reviews and termination clauses to protect both parties.</p> <ul><li>Research local <b>market-rate buildings</b> for benchmark packages.</li> <li>Discuss work schedules upfront to avoid disputes over 24-hour maintenance.</li> <li>Secure written commitments for utility coverage and emergency contact protocols.</li> <li>Negotiate vendor coordination roles if the super oversees contractors.</li></ul> <p>Property owners benefit from strong terms that ensure code compliance and preventive maintenance logs. This approach fosters long-term retention for reliable building management.</p> <h2>Alternatives to Live-In Supers</h2> <p>Management companies charge 8-12% of gross rents, such as $96K for a 50-unit building, compared to $48K for a live-in super. These firms handle super duties like emergency repairs, tenant complaints, and unit turnover. Property owners save time on <b>hiring a super</b> and oversight.</p> <p>Outsourcing to a property management company provides 24/7 coverage without the need for a super apartment or free rent perks. They manage plumbing repairs, HVAC maintenance, and vendor coordination for multi-family buildings. This suits high-rise or large co-op buildings with many apartment units.</p> <p>A hybrid model combines part-time help with emergency services for balanced coverage. For example, schedule a handyman for routine <b>lobby maintenance</b> and trash removal during weekdays. Add on-call support for lockouts or boiler issues after hours.</p> <p>Small buildings often skip live-in staff to cut <b>cost of super</b> expenses like salary compensation and overtime pay. Evaluate building size and local regulations to pick the right alternative. Consider tenant rights and landlord obligations for reliable on-site maintenance.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Option</th> <th>Cost</th> <th>Coverage</th> <th>Best For</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Property Mgmt Co</td> <td>8-12% rents</td> <td>24/7</td> <td>Large buildings</td></tr> <tr><td>Part-time (20hr)</td> <td>$36K/yr</td> <td>9-5</td> <td>Small buildings</td></tr> <tr><td>On-call service</td> <td>$120/call</td> <td>Emergencies</td> <td>4-8 units</td></tr> <tr><td>Handyman contracts</td> <td>$45/hr</td> <td>Scheduled</td> <td>Luxury</td></tr> <tr><td>Hybrid (Part-time + Emergency)</td> <td>Varies</td> <td>Flexible</td> <td>Medium buildings</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>What Is a Live-In Super and Does My Building Need One?</h3> <p>A live-in super, short for superintendent, is a building maintenance professional who resides on-site in the property they manage.
