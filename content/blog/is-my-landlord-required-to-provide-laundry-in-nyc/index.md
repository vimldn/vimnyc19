<p>Staring at a pile of laundry with no washer in sight? In NYC, your landlord might owe you more than you think.</p> <p>From the <b>Multiple Dwelling Law</b> and <b>Housing Maintenance Code</b> to rules splitting buildings by size-1-10 units vs. 11+-we break down on-site vs. in-unit requirements, rent-stabilized perks, exceptions, and how to fight back if you're laundry-less. Curious if you're entitled? Keep reading.</p><h2>NYC Housing Laws Overview</h2><img alt="NYC Housing Laws Overview" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/is-my-landlord-required-to-provide-laundry-in-nyc(80v4)_1.jpeg"/> <p>NYC landlords must follow strict <b>laundry rules</b> under Multiple Dwelling Law 78 and Housing Maintenance Code 27-2008. The Multiple Dwelling Law requires laundry facilities in buildings over 10 units. The Housing Maintenance Code mandates that these facilities stay in working condition.</p> <p>Landlords face enforcement from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, known as <b>HPD</b>. Tenants can report issues through 311 or the HPDonline portal. This leads to inspections and potential violations for non-compliance.</p> <p>In practice, a tenant in a <i>20-unit building</i> without on-site washers and dryers can file a complaint. Housing Court handles disputes, often requiring landlords to provide <b>shared laundry</b>. Experts recommend checking your lease for any <b>amenities clause</b> mentioning laundry access.</p> <p>Building owners must ensure <b>habitability</b> under Real Property Law 235-b. Broken machines violate the warranty of habitability. Tenants should document problems with photos before seeking repairs or rent abatement.</p> <h3>Multiple Dwelling Law</h3> <p>Multiple Dwelling Law 78 mandates <b>laundry facilities</b> in all NYC Class A multiple dwellings with more than 10 units. This applies to most apartment buildings. Landlords must provide at least one washer per 15 units and one dryer per 20 units in a dedicated room.</p> <p>The law covers <b>Class A multiple dwellings</b>, like rental apartments with three or more permanent families. Smaller buildings or single-family homes have no such requirement. Tenants in walk-ups or high-rises over 10 units can demand on-site laundry if absent.</p> <p>For example, a <i>12-unit brownstone</i> needs a communal laundry space with proper hookups. HPD issues B37 violations for missing facilities, leading to fines. A 2019 Appellate Division ruling strengthened enforcement for shared laundry in older tenements.</p> <p>Property managers should verify their building's <b>certificate of occupancy</b> for compliance. Tenants facing denial of access can contact DOB for Multiple Dwelling Law text. Legal aid groups assist with Housing Court filings if landlords ignore obligations.</p> <h3>Housing Maintenance Code</h3> <p>HMC 27-2008 requires landlords maintain laundry facilities in good working order. HPD classifies broken washers or dryers as <b>Class B violations</b>, with fines starting at $500. Tenants get a 30-day cure period before further action.</p> <p>Landlords must repair issues like clogged drains or faulty electrical outlets promptly. Non-working coin-operated machines trigger inspections via tenant complaints. Use the HPDonline portal to look up violations for your building address.</p> <p>Consider a scenario where the <i>dryer in a shared laundry room</i> stops heating. File a 311 complaint, and HPD may issue a notice of violation. If ignored, pursue an HP action in NYC Housing Court for repairs or rent reduction.</p> <p>Fines escalate for repeat offenses, up to $1,000 per violation under the NYC Administrative Code. Superintendents handle routine maintenance like lint trap cleaning. Tenants should notify the management company in writing to start the cure period.</p> <h2>Laundry Requirements by Building Size</h2> <p>NYC law differentiates <b>laundry requirements</b> by <b>building size</b>. Buildings with 1-10 units face no mandate under the Multiple Dwelling Law (MDL). Larger buildings with 11 or more units must follow strict rules.</p> <p>The <b>MDL 78</b> applies only to buildings over 10 units. Small buildings remain exempt but tenants can rely on <b>lease promises</b> and warranty of habitability claims. Landlords in exempt buildings often advertise <i>laundromat proximity</i> to attract renters.</p> <p>For 11+ unit buildings, landlords must provide on-site laundry facilities meeting exact ratios. Tenants should check their certificate of occupancy and file complaints with HPD or 311 if facilities fall short. This ensures access to <b>washers</b> and dryers as a basic housing right.</p> <p>Understanding these distinctions helps tenants know their rights and <b>obligations</b>. In rent-stabilized or rent-controlled units, laundry access ties into broader amenities clauses. Consult <b>NYC Housing Court</b> for disputes over missing facilities.</p> <h3>Buildings with 1-10 Units</h3> <p>Buildings with 1-10 units are exempt from <b>MDL laundry requirements</b>. No law forces landlords to install washers or <b>dryers</b> on-site. Tenants turn to lease terms for protection.</p> <p>Lease <b>amenities clauses</b> are enforceable under Real Property Law 235-b. If a listing promises <i>laundry access</i>, the landlord must deliver or face breach claims. Common in <b>brownstones</b> and townhouses, these clauses cover shared laundry or hookups.</p> <ul><li>No <b>statutory requirement</b> exists due to MDL 4 exemption for small buildings.</li> <li><b>Lease promises</b> bind landlords, allowing tenants to withhold rent or sue in <b>small claims court</b>.</li> <li>Many advertise <i>laundromat proximity</i> to meet tenant needs without in-building machines.</li> <li>Negotiate <b>laundry hookups</b> in tenant improvement agreements before signing.</li></ul> <p>Tenants in these buildings can push for <b>in-unit laundry</b> during lease renewal. Report issues to HPD if promised facilities lack maintenance. This approach upholds the <b>warranty of habitability</b> without triggering larger regulations.</p> <h3>Buildings with 11+ Units</h3><img alt="Buildings with 11+ Units" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/is-my-landlord-required-to-provide-laundry-in-nyc(80v4)_2.jpeg"/> <p>MDL 78 mandates 11+ unit buildings provide a laundry room with specific ratios: <b>1 washer per 15 units</b>, 1 dryer per 20 units, and a minimum of 2 machines. These rules apply to class A multiple dwellings. Landlords face <b>HPD B37 violation</b> codes for non-compliance.</p> <p>The <b>Housing Maintenance Code 27-2009</b> requires <b>24/7 access</b> to communal laundry. Machines must be coin-operated or card-based and kept in good repair. Tenants report shortages via 311 complaints, prompting inspections.</p> <ul><li>Exact ratios ensure enough capacity for all residents during peak hours.</li> <li><b>Superintendent</b> or <b>property manager</b> must maintain machines, fixing breakdowns promptly.</li> <li>Violations lead to fines and <b>correction notices</b> from <b>Department of Housing Preservation and Development</b>.</li> <li>Check <b>DOB Building Information System</b> for your building's compliance history.</li></ul> <p>In practice, high-rises often feature <b>stackable units</b> or <b>front-load washers</b> in dedicated rooms. If ratios fall short, tenants form a tenant association to demand upgrades. Legal aid or a housing lawyer can enforce these obligations in court.</p> <h2>On-Site vs. In-Unit Laundry</h2> <p>NYC law requires on-site laundry rooms in buildings with 11 or more units, but <b>in-unit hookups</b> are optional amenities negotiable in leases. Under Multiple Dwelling Law Section 78, landlords must provide shared laundry facilities in larger buildings to meet basic <b>habitability standards</b>. Tenants in smaller buildings may need to use off-site laundromats.</p> <p>The <b>NYC Rent Guidelines Board</b> notes that in-unit laundry adds about $89 per month to stabilized rents. This premium reflects the added convenience of private washers and dryers in the apartment. Landlords often list it as an <i>amenity clause</i> in the lease to justify rent increases.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Legal Requirement</th><th>Cost to Tenant</th><th>Availability</th><th>Maintenance</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>On-Site</td><td>MDL 78 required (11+ units)</td><td>Free/coin-op ($2-4/load)</td><td>24/7 access</td><td>Landlord responsibility</td></tr> <tr><td>In-Unit</td><td>Optional amenity</td><td>Higher rent ($75-150/mo premium)</td><td>Exclusive use</td><td>Tenant responsibility</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>On-site laundry offers <b>shared access</b> for all tenants, often with coin-operated machines in the basement or laundry room. Tenants pay per load, keeping building costs low. If machines break, report to the <b>superintendent</b> or property manager for repairs under landlord obligations.</p> <p>In-unit setups provide privacy but require tenants to handle maintenance like cleaning lint traps or calling service for error codes. Check lease terms for <b>installation hookups</b>, plumbing, and electrical needs before move-in. Negotiate during lease renewal if seeking this upgrade in rent-stabilized units.</p> <h2>Exceptions and Waivers</h2> <p>Only <b>47 NYC buildings</b> have active <b>DOB laundry waivers</b> as shown in the DOB BIS database (2024 data), mostly historic brownstones and SROs after a variance process taking 6-12 months. These waivers allow landlords to skip on-site laundry requirements under specific conditions. Tenants should check the BIS database for their building's status before filing complaints.</p> <p>Landlords pursue waivers to avoid costly retrofits in older structures. Common exceptions include <b>DOB Alt2 variances</b>, historic protections, and SRO exemptions. Understanding these helps tenants know when laundry is not required by law.</p> <p>The <b>NYC Housing Maintenance Code</b> sets laundry rules, but waivers provide legal relief for unique cases. For example, a pre-war brownstone might get approval if adding washers would harm its structure. Tenants in waived buildings often rely on nearby laundromats.</p> <p>Check your certificate of occupancy and lease for laundry clauses. If no waiver exists, landlords must provide access to a <i>coin-operated laundry room</i> or in-unit hookups in class A multiple dwellings. Contact HPD or DOB for verification.</p> <h3>Key Exceptions to Laundry Requirements</h3> <p>NYC law lists specific <b>exceptions and waivers</b> where landlords avoid providing on-site laundry. These apply to certain building types and require official approvals. Tenants can review DOB records to confirm if their rental qualifies.</p> <ul><li><b>DOB Alt2 variance</b>: Owners file Form PW1 for alternative compliance, like shared laundry in a nearby unit, if plumbing limits full installation.</li> <li><b>Historic buildings</b>: Structures with LPC approval keep original designs without modern laundry to preserve architecture.</li> <li><b>SROs exempt under MDL 4(41)</b>: Single room occupancies focus on basic habitability, skipping laundry amenities.</li> <li><b>Buildings with laundromat leases within 200ft</b>: Proof of a leased coin-op facility nearby satisfies the rule.</li> <li><b>New construction with MIH affordable units</b>: Mandatory Inclusionary Housing projects may waive if plans prioritize other affordable features.</li></ul> <h3>Variance Application Checklist</h3> <p>Landlords seeking a <b>laundry waiver</b> must follow a strict DOB process. Start with an engineer's report on why standard laundry is impossible. Submit Form PW1 with plans and fees for Alt2 review.</p> <ol><li>Document building constraints like <i>old plumbing</i> or structural issues.</li> <li>Get PE-stamped drawings showing alternatives.</li> <li>File PW1 and attend public review if needed.</li> <li>Respond to DOB objections within deadlines.</li> <li>Secure final sign-off after inspection.</li></ol> <p>The process often takes <b>6-12 months</b>, with many applications approved after revisions. Tenants facing denial can challenge via 311 or housing court if no waiver exists.</p> <h3>Practical Advice for Tenants</h3><img alt="Practical Advice for Tenants" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/is-my-landlord-required-to-provide-laundry-in-nyc(80v4)_3.jpeg"/> <p>If your building claims a waiver, verify it in the <b>DOB BIS database</b>. False claims violate the Housing Maintenance Code and trigger fines. Report suspected issues to HPD for inspection.</p> <p>For example, in a rent-stabilized SRO, no laundry is standard under MDL exemptions. But class A dwellings without waivers must offer access, even in walk-ups. Negotiate lease terms for laundry improvements if possible.</p> <p>Consult <b>legal aid</b> or NYC Housing Court for disputes. Landlords cannot evade obligations without proper DOB or LPC approval. Track nearby laundromats as backups in waived buildings.</p> <h2>Rent-Stabilized Buildings</h2> <p>Rent-stabilized buildings face <b>stricter laundry enforcement</b> through RSC 2524.3, with DHCR tracking laundry amenities in annual registrations. These <b>rent-stabilized</b> properties must maintain laundry as a registered amenity. Landlords cannot remove it without proper approvals.</p> <p>RGB orders cannot remove laundry without <b>DHCR approval</b>. Tenants in these buildings have strong protections under the <b>Rent Stabilization Code</b>. For example, if a laundry room is listed, the landlord must keep it operational or seek formal permission to change it.</p> <p>Practical advice for tenants: Check your building's <b>DHCR registration</b> online to confirm listed amenities like on-site washers and dryers. If laundry is missing or broken, file a complaint with HPD or DHCR. This ensures the landlord upholds their obligations.</p> <p>Landlords should document any plans to alter amenities carefully. Violations can lead to fines or rent reduction orders in NYC Housing Court. Tenants can also request repairs through 311 for issues like faulty coin-operated machines.</p> <h3>RSO Laundry Rules</h3> <p>Rent Stabilization Code 2524.3 prohibits removing <b>laundry rooms</b> registered in DHCR database without tenant approval or RGB order. This rule protects <b>on-site laundry</b> as a key amenity in rent-stabilized apartments. Landlords must provide access to shared washers and dryers unless formally excused.</p> <p>A 2022 DHCR Opinion Letter #12 clarifies that <b>coin-op revenue</b> belongs to the landlord. Tenants cannot claim it, but they gain rights to functional equipment. For instance, if machines break, the landlord must repair or replace them promptly to avoid violations.</p> <p>Removal requires a <b>60-day tenant notice</b> plus RGB application. This process gives tenants time to object or form a tenant association. Experts recommend consulting legal aid before agreeing to any changes affecting communal laundry.</p> <p>To enforce rules, tenants can file with DHCR or HPD for <b>code violations</b>. Landlords face penalties for ignoring registered amenities. Always review your lease for any amenities clause mentioning laundry access hours or maintenance.</p> <h2>Tenant Rights and Enforcement</h2> <p>Tenants without <b>promised laundry</b> can file 311 complaints triggering HPD inspections. This process often results in Class B violations and potential HP actions in NYC Housing Court. Knowing your rights under the warranty of habitability enables you to demand repairs or amenities like on-site washers and dryers.</p> <p>The Housing Maintenance Code requires landlords to maintain essential services in rental buildings. If your lease includes a <i>laundry room</i> or in-unit machines, failure to provide them breaches this code. Tenants in rent-stabilized apartments have added protections against such omissions.</p> <p>Enforcement follows clear steps through city agencies like the <b>Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD)</b>. Start by documenting issues with photos of broken <i>coin-operated machines</i> or missing hookups. This builds a strong case for inspections and penalties.</p> <ol><li>Call <b>311</b> to log a complaint and get a confirmation number for your records.</li> <li>Request an <b>HPD inspection</b>, which typically occurs within 14 days of the report.</li> <li>If violations are found, HPD issues a <b>Class B violation</b> with fines starting at $500 plus daily penalties until fixed.</li> <li>File an <b>HP action</b> in NYC Housing Court for a $45 fee to force repairs.</li> <li>Seek <b>rent abatement</b>, where courts often award 10-25% reductions based on the laundry's impact on habitability.</li></ol> <p>In 2023, NYC Housing Court saw 2,847 laundry-related cases with tenants winning 76% of them. Use HPDonline to check violation status on your building. Persistent issues may involve tenant associations or legal aid for stronger advocacy.</p> <h2>What to Do If No Laundry Provided</h2> <p>No laundry in <b>11+ unit buildings</b>? Follow this 5-step enforcement plan used successfully by tenants in NYC. Local laws under the Housing Maintenance Code require on-site laundry in such buildings. This plan helps tenants enforce their <b>rights to amenities</b>.</p> <p>Start by gathering evidence from your <b>lease</b> and building details. Many tenants find success by acting quickly through official channels. Use this structured approach to demand <b>compliance</b> from your landlord.</p> <p>If your building has <i>12 units or more</i>, laundry facilities like a <b>shared laundry room</b> with washers and dryers must be provided. Smaller buildings may not face this obligation. Always check your specific <b>multiple dwelling</b> status with HPD.</p> <ol><li>Document any lease promises about laundry and photograph the building entrance to prove its size. Take dated photos of the unit count sign or entrance, and note the address clearly. This creates a strong record for later steps.</li> <li>Call <b>311 same day</b> to file a complaint and get a <b>confirmation number</b>. Mention the lack of on-site laundry in an 11+ unit building under Housing Maintenance Code. Keep the reference number for your records.</li> <li>Email your <b>landlord</b> via certified mail demanding compliance within a <b>10-day deadline</b>. Include photos, 311 confirmation, and cite relevant <b>local laws</b>. Request installation of coin-operated machines or a laundry room.</li> <li>File an <b>HP-1 form</b> in NYC Housing Court for $45, or get free legal aid. Download the exact HP-1 form from the NYC Courts website. This starts a court order for repairs or amenities.</li> <li>Request <b>20% rent abatement</b> during non-compliance in your HP action. Courts often grant reductions for missing required laundry facilities. Combine with demands for habitability fixes like heat or pests.</li></ol> <p>Contact the <b>Legal Aid Society</b> at 212-577-3300 for free consultation on <b>housing court</b> filings. They assist tenants with HP actions and rent disputes. Many win abatements for code violations.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><img alt="Frequently Asked Questions" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/is-my-landlord-required-to-provide-laundry-in-nyc(80v4)_4.jpeg"/><h3>Is My Landlord Required to Provide Laundry in NYC?</h3> <p>No, landlords in New York City are not legally required to provide laundry facilities, such as in-unit washers/dryers or access to on-site laundry rooms, in rental apartments. Laundry is considered an amenity, not a necessity under NYC Housing Maintenance Code or Rent Stabilization laws. Tenants in rent-stabilized or rent-controlled units have protections for essential services like heat and hot water, but laundry access isn't mandated.</p> <h3>What NYC Laws Govern Laundry Requirements for Landlords?</h3> <p>NYC's Multiple Dwelling Law and Housing Maintenance Code outline required building services like plumbing, electricity, and sanitation, but do not include laundry facilities. The Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY) and NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) confirm that providing laundry is optional. Check your lease agreement for any building-specific amenities promised.</p> <h3>Are There Exceptions Where Landlords Must Provide Laundry in NYC?</h3> <p>There are no broad exceptions requiring laundry in standard rentals, but certain subsidized housing programs (e.g., Section 8 or NYC Housing Authority properties) may have specific rules. For luxury or new developments under Local Law 97 or zoning incentives, laundry might be advertised as standard, but it's contractual, not legally mandated. Always review your lease for promised amenities.</p> <h3>What If My Lease Promised Laundry But It's Not Provided in NYC?</h3> <p>If your lease explicitly mentions laundry facilities (e.g., "on-site laundry room" or "in-unit W/D"), the landlord must provide them or equivalent. Failure to do so could be a breach of lease, allowing you to request repairs, rent abatement, or withhold rent via HP Action (Housing Part of NYC Civil Court). Document issues and notify your landlord in writing first.</p> <h3>Can I Install My Own Washer/Dryer If Landlord Doesn't Provide Laundry in NYC?</h3> <p>You generally cannot install personal laundry appliances without landlord approval, as it may violate building plumbing/electrical codes or Multiple Dwelling Law. Portable units might be allowed if they don't alter plumbing, but get written permission to avoid eviction risks. Many NYC buildings prohibit them due to shared infrastructure strain.</p> <h3>What Alternatives Exist If No Laundry Is Provided by Landlord in NYC?</h3> <p>Common options include nearby laundromats (ubiquitous in NYC), shared building laundry if available voluntarily, or negotiating with roommates for off-site solutions. Some tenants use stackable portables or delivery services like Washly. For complaints about unlivable conditions (not laundry), contact 311 or HPD; for amenities disputes, consult a tenant lawyer via NYC Bar Association resources.</p><h2>Related reading</h2><ul><li><a href="/blog/what-happens-if-my-landlord-overcharged-me-on-a-rent-stabilized-apartment">What Happens If My Landlord Overcharged Me on a Rent Stabilized Apartment?</a></li><li><a href="/blog/can-my-landlord-refuse-to-renew-my-rent-stabilized-lease">Can My Landlord Refuse to Renew My Rent Stabilized Lease?</a></li><li><a href="/blog/can-i-sue-my-landlord-for-ignoring-violations">Can I Sue My Landlord for Ignoring Violations?</a></li></ul><div class="mt-8 p-4 rounded-xl border border-[#1e293b] bg-[#0f172a]"><p class="font-semibold">Check your building on Building Health X</p><p class="text-sm text-[#94a3b8] mt-1">Run a quick check before you sign: heat/hot water, pests, noise, safety hazards, and more.</p><p class="mt-3"><a class="inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-4 py-2 rounded-lg bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700" href="/">Check an address</a></p></div>
